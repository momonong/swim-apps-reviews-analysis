However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don‚Äôt have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There‚Äôs no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don‚Äôt take the proper steps of progression then I don‚Äôt get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",0.99827033

UPDATE:
Response from Form: ‚ÄúUnfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.‚Äù

My Response:
First, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I‚Äôm sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin‚Äôs limitation? 

BTW, I‚Äôve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.",0.99827033

However, subscription price for workouts in addition to the high initial cost of buying their product is a slap in the face.

You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

See below the email I received from FORM.

If you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM‚Äôs only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ‚Ä¶.FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

176,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don‚Äôt have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There‚Äôs no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don‚Äôt take the proper steps of progression then I don‚Äôt get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",0.23989701
177,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"I like the FORM goggles and what they provide, but I just cannot understand why I need to pay an extra $19 a month to import workouts I write myself into a product I already own. 

If I wanted to access the library, or share workouts with my friends (spoiler - I have none. I‚Äôm a triathlete‚Ä¶ lol) that would be one thing. But it seems exploitative to force me to pay a recurring fee to use even the most basic feature.

UPDATE:
Response from Form: ‚ÄúUnfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.‚Äù

My Response:
First, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I‚Äôm sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin‚Äôs limitation? 

BTW, I‚Äôve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.",0.23989701
179,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"Goggles/software do function well and as advertised. However, subscription price for workouts in addition to the high initial cost of buying their product is a slap in the face. Almost every other sport tracking wearable gives you the ability to integrate workouts with no extra cost. I will stick to manually performing workouts with the unsubscribed version until they break, then likely seek a different brand.",0.23989701
180,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"I have these googles and they are pretty neat.  I‚Äôm fortunate to be grandfathered in and the workouts features are nice.  I‚Äôm very disappointed that Form decided to move to a subscription model for any future users.  You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

See below the email I received from FORM.

If you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26. Real-time metrics in pool, open water, and swim spa are now part of the FORM membership. New swimmers will be required to have an active membership to access this and all member features.",0.23989701
181,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"I have been using the goggles regularly for both pool and OW swims. Both with Apple Watch and Garmin connect as the goggles when used for OW simply function as a display while the Watch control the recording and swim.

1. Current pace not available, only average page for entire workout
2. HR displayed after pausing workout is wrong, both in FORM app and goggles. Heart rate shown is 20 BPM above actual rate and when examine using the FORM app the entire second half of the swim has HR increased by 20 BPM compared to first half.

In short totally unreliable data.

Furthermore this kind of errors are obvious software bugs and reveals that the goggles have not been tested properly when used for OW swims.

The only thing the goggles can be used for during OW swim is to display the total distance.",0.23989701

That‚Äôs a big trade off to have have data that is available, slightly delayed, from other sources like Apple Watch and and pool time clocks.  Open water swimming requires navigation and spotting landmarks.  This is extremely difficult with the tunnel vision and smoked tint of these google.  Feels like you are swimming in a cave.

196,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM‚Äôs only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ‚Ä¶.FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",0.23989701
