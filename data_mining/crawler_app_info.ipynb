       " 'comments': [\"I have always been a good distance swimmer, but not a fast one. I don't particularly care to race, but I do want to swim faster, improve my techniques, and get the best swim workouts possible. This app helps me do just that. From the technique videos to guided workouts and monthly challenges, my swimpro has coached me to better swimming in a short time. Love this app! It's a totally worthwhile investment!\",\n",
       "  'If you never swam competitively ever, or dont want the hassle of doing a quick google search, then this app is okay. However, as a past swimmer and current coach, the sets are somewhat stale, and the majority of them are behind what i would consider to be a decently high paywall. i get the desire to charge for this, but it shouldbt be nearly so expensive, and you shouls feel like you are getting a lot more for your money. The only nice thing i see is that they are color coded',\n",
       "  \"While this app seems very progressive, easy to use and like a genuinely good option for learning swimmers, athletes, etc., it costs a lot just to get a training plan! It would be great if I can just learn new techniques and become a better swimmer without having to pay 9.99$ a month - which I can ALREADY learn how to be with my school's swim coach. I don't think it should cost this much for an extra boost.\",\n",
       "  \"Update: moving down to one star as I've contacted support and received no answer. App seems good, but is very buggy...good workouts, but interface is often crashing or lagging, wont log workout plans, etc. Paid for the Premium subscription and now it wont give me access to premium features...and appears to have deleted a week of data. I'm sure Ill have a heck of a time getting any refund! Needed improvement to keep my business...now Im going to an alternate app.\",\n",
       "  'As a beginner swimmer who is working on my strokes and techniques, the app has been helpful in having everything I need in one place. The video demonstration and the workout plan in one place is really helpful for someone who either is new to swimming or is an advanced swimmer. The monthly challenges inside the app also keeps it fun to stay active and hold oneself accountable for it. Adding the dryland training has been very helpful as well.',\n",
       "  \"Easy to use, you can pick and choose from available workouts or make your own. Syncs to my Garmin watch so I don't need a pace clock, and can workout without the hassle! After a week of use, it randomly stopped working on my Garmin Fenix 5X. Charlie from MySwimPro's tech support spent the better part of the last few days working to resolve the issue with me. Already loved the app, but the effort put in to fix the issue was outstanding. Great app and an even better team behind it!\",\n",
       "  'Love this app! I started using this app on the free model! I created my own custom workouts each day and then loaded them onto my watch! I eventually decided to try the 7 day free trial to use all of the features and I wish I had done it sooner! The workout of the day is what I normally do and I love being able to track my split times and see my improvement over time! Customer support has been super helpful with getting me set up on my subscription( -had some issues with the play store)',\n",
       "  \"Swim workouts seem legit, however no real guidance to do the test workouts to get the dynamic pacing in place. Analysis is extra, 50, 100 or 150 bucks... But no explanation what that entails. No coach profiles to see what their credentials are. The Garmin IQ app integration is worthless, doesn't work at all. After some research this is an ongoing issue for over a year. App is a good concept. Just not refined enough for 119 a year. There are free alternatives that work flawlessly.\",\n",
       "  \"I was enthusiastic about this app but... I'm very glad that I didn't pay for whole year. App for WearOS is useless. There is literally no sync with mobile app. Some content is repeating itself without clear explanation what you have to do. Some content doesn't even open and videos do not play. Out of the water exercises are ok but app freeze when you try to end or save it. If you took beginners training,l you still have to know every single swimming phrase. Awful app for that price. Poor quality\",\n",
       "  \"The watch app does not work with Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. I've requested for support from Dev team but got very poor response. Seems like Android is not their priority and they don't even enable Location permission on the watch. While the online tutorials are great, I just cannot use the training program on the watch as it does not record laps taken. Adequate Screenshots have already been shared with the team.\",\n",
       "  \"The only reason I can't give 5 stars it's because the Apple version still looks bether than the Android one, but I hope this change in the future. I hed some issues with the app in the beginning due to some bugs in the Android version, but they were promptly and quickly solved after I've reported the issues to the support team, which was great in quicly leting me know that the issues was fixed. This was a good demonstration of how much they value their customers, I'm very happy with that.\",\n",
       "  'Black screen for training videos. Clearly still not working, despite this being stated in a previous review that it was fixed. The app was patched on 27th Jan. Please could you provide an update. Edit: despite being assured it is fixed, it is not. The rating stands and honestly it is very frustrating.',\n",
       "  'I love this app and it keeps evolving to improve the experience. Their support is also quick. Their plans do as intended and I am constantly impressed by my ability to learn new techniques with the guidance and videos given to compliment the workouts.a1l',\n",
       "  'This app is gold! With plenty of workouts to make your swimming experience enjoyable and progressive! Videos are clear and brief, and the appearance is nice as well.',\n",
       "  \"The app is good but using an android, it has glitches that aren't on Apple. When I save a practice, it will change what I save in two or more sets to still equal the same yardage, but different. Like I have 2*500 all out and 600 warm down, it saves 2*600 and 400 warm down.\",\n",
       "  'Not for Wear OS users. Bought a Samsung Watch 4 relying on their announcement of support for Wear OS watches. But too many bugs and errors that crop up when doing just routine stuff that any swimmer would do makes me regret the purchase. Sent them feedback with all the issues encountered, still waiting for the promised watch app update.',\n",
       "  'It is a useful app, and it makes it easier to coach myself while in the pool. The exercise videos help explain how to a drill or a certain technique. I highly recommend it for swimmers who work full time.',\n",
       "  \"For some reason it is impossible to deselect freestyle when asked what styles you can swim 100m. That's the style I struggle with because of form, breast and back I can do but freestyle I wanted to deselect... Impossible\",\n",
       "  \"Absolutely useless..app is only for swimmers who already know all the lingo and the layout of the workouts..like a foreign language.. nothing broken down or simplified for the beginner.. and the 'helpful' videos don't even play.. wouldn't even be worth it if it was free\",\n",
       "  'Absolutely exorbitant fees. No way is any app worth $170 AUD per year, get a grip! Avoid...unless you have money to burn.'],\n",
