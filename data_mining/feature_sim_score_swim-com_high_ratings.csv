0,track your swims and achieve your goals,"After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",0.5984183
1,track your swims and achieve your goals,"They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets. 

Still, I do like the improvements they’ve made in the last few years. Keep working on it.",0.80806
2,track your swims and achieve your goals,"At 70 yo I sometimes ( no, all the time) need motivation in these times to get up and do something healthy   Keeping track of my daily yardage and checking cumulative weekly, monthly and annual yards against others in similar age groups keeps me getting up early and driving daily to the Y.  Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.",0.80806
3,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Installed this app because I was looking for some better views on my watch of laps, time, heart rate, etc when swimming. The Apple Workout app wasn’t cutting it for me. The watch views are exactly what I was looking for but I noticed after a couple swims that my active calories are significantly under reported compared to the Apple app. When comparing heart rate data from other workouts it seems this app is under reporting rather than other apps over reporting. The difference is significant for a 30 minute workout, about half the reported calories.",0.80806
4,track your swims and achieve your goals,I like this app because it’s the only one I know of that lets me edit back in my kick set yardage after the workout is done. There is no choice for a kick set in the editing section so I call them a drill. App worked well until recently then suddenly stopped uploading data to Apple health. After about one month an update was released and now everything is working properly again.,0.81416076
5,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Easy to use and manually add my yardage. I have a iWatch but can't figure out how to use it with this site
When I click the Leaderboard, it only shows I've done 75yds so I'm obviously doing something wrong as my 3x per week swims are close to 7,500.  I'm 67 yrs of age and since covid pandemic have been away from synchronized swimming so loving the pool again 
Not techi but at least I can manually enter my yardage
Reported my pool as having changed names and it was quickly corrected!   Thank you!",0.59744525
6,track your swims and achieve your goals,Communicated with John who was very helpful. App has always correctly recorded times for me for the almost two years that I’ve used it. But one swim recently showed correct total time but recorded each length as exactly same time - obvious error. John guided me through a few steps and consulted with his engineer. Problem seems to have fixed itself. I appreciated John’s concern and his checking in with me later to verify app was working fine now.,0.80806
7,track your swims and achieve your goals,Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line,0.80806
8,track your swims and achieve your goals,"This app works. I am not sure where all the complaints come from. It counts laps, yards/meters, shows heart rate in one place. The new redesign on AW is just perfect. Especially the color coding. The stats on phone seems to be a little “cluttered” but still show all that is needed. This review comes from a guy with over 40 years of experience swimming. To developers, keep up the great work. Thanks!",0.80806
9,track your swims and achieve your goals,This has been happening to me in the past month at least one a week and I was hoping the new update would fix this but it happened again today and I lost all my data! I was doing a drill and I was ready to do my last 100 yards and I looked at my watch to check my pace and the app was back to the start as if I had not just swim 2500 yards.,0.80806
10,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Only complaint is there’s no option to NOT put in distance. Sometimes I just swim for “time” and don’t count the distance. App requires a multiple to place in the distance box. I just put in a random number and then in the notes I explain what I did on this particular training day. Other than that, app is easy to use and very useful, especially for me as a “returning swimmer”, so I can measure my progress. Cheers!",0.6132403
11,track your swims and achieve your goals,"My primary complaint is that the last lap appears to throw in a couple of seconds. One can check this by comparing the splits against the last. Now to work around this problem, I simply add another 50 yards to the interval and use the next to last split and final times. And it makes a better workout!

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

You are building a very good tool and our requests are a testimony that we’re using it but want more. Very common in the software business.

As I mentioned earlier I would be happy to pay for this app so don’t stop!

And thank you!",0.80806
12,track your swims and achieve your goals,"More accurate than iSwimStat, and I compare it with a couple others but this doesn’t load quickly. It takes hours or even days to show up even though I refresh many times. Not sure if I’m using it correctly.  Synched with Apple Watch.",0.8182067
13,track your swims and achieve your goals,I like this app - it’s free and you can’t argue with the value for what it does (other apps charge you for stats/membership). The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is my being unable to put/list myself on leaderboard. Perhaps it’s just a learning curve - I’m using this app only for a 3-4 months. Do you know how I can fix that?,0.80806
14,track your swims and achieve your goals,"In my opinion, the best app. It stops automatically, you have the possibility to record distance swam for drill mode (apple watch native exercise app does not offer this possibilty), you have the possibility to swim a set in a fixed amount of time (repeat in), which is another important feature that the native app does not have).",0.81475025
15,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from regarding accuracy. This app comes within 50 yards of my 3000+ yard workouts, and gathers excellent data. The best part, however, is an easily accessible drill mode for kick sets. Best swim app available at time of this writing, and I’ve tried them all.",0.69348735

17,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Never had an issue with calorie transfer to health app until the recent update that was supposed to fix an issue regarding that.

18,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Have nearly 900k yards tracked with only a handful of errors. Accurate tracking, consistent splits, and one button start/stop. On top of that, developers that listen and want to fix issues and constantly make this app better. Highly recommended.",0.81778365
19,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I had some issues with the Swim app on my Apple Watch a few years ago so I switched to Apple’s swim workout app -that is until Swim stopped loading the data (I think due to an Apple update)

Now that I’m using Swim again, I notice two problems. 

1) the calories count is about half what it should be on my 2250 yard swim, but agrees with Apple’s count on my 250 yard swim. 

2) I typically do a long swim (2250 yds) followed by a short (250 yd swim). My last 2 sessions (using the Swim app on my Apple Watch 3) only one swim would load on swim. 
One time the app crashed when I ended the longer swim.",0.80806

35,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Pretty good app. Syncing with my Garmin device finally after multiple attempts. I like the easy to read format and the ability to add a pool as well as a few other features though if I had my wishes I would request:
- my records section. I want to see my best times for different distances. It is cool to show a badge for fastest 400 yard but what is that time record? I think you can see this on the site but I could not find in app. 
- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths 
- more workouts to do. Options seem pretty limited to shorter distances. Master swim classes will do a 1650 for warm up. 
- drill videos would be cool. I know they are available through you tube but it would be cool if they were here and built into the workouts.",0.80806

DOWNLOAD NOW!!!",0.84042513
38,track your swims and achieve your goals,"At first I was disappointed that the app didn't count my breaststroke or kick sets, but the more I use it, I see that it's algorithm is learning my strokes and adapting its analysis. All my breaststroke is now counted accurately and is starting to sometimes give me credit for kick sets. 

Even if it never quite gets the kicks counted, the ability to sense the difference between swimming and resting and the stats (some of which you can access immediately) put this app head and shoulders above the others I've tried on the Apple Watch.",0.6238563
39,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Still a little buggy. I uninstalled, then reinstalled after the app crashed when I still had 20 laps to complete. It may have been the Apple Watch because the Apple logo appeared and I couldn't bring up any apps. I thought maybe the watch was downloading an IOS update or something. Whatever. It's just very frustrating. I lost all of today's data. Maybe my resistance gloves got in the way and pressed the stem. Other than that, I like this app. Some issues with lap count and stroke recognition though. Not a big deal for a casual swimmer like me.",0.6427421
40,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I have just started using this new app for my swim routines and I can say that this is one of the better swim apps out there so far. I love being able to track my workouts and comparing lap times with my friends and other people who are using this app with ease. Not only that, just from using the app today, I found a few new local pools in my area that I didn't know even existed before! Now that the new Apple Watch is waterproof, this is my go-to swim app to use with it.",0.80806
41,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Bought a new waterproof Apple Watch last week, been shopping for best swim app. My master swim mates recommended this app to me. Absolutely love it!!  Love the fact that this app not only can track my daily swim workout, but also allow me to connect with other swimmers.  The best feature is that I can locate the pool close by using this app. This is huge for me since I need to travel a lot because of work, this make my life much easier as I want to keep swimming every day.",0.80806
42,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I've been using this app with my Apple Watch Series 2 for about three weeks. I have not tried to get super accurate information from it, but it does a very nice job of tracking my yardage and giving me a sense of how I was performing. 

The quick drill setup on the watch is an excellent way to capture those kicking yards that don't get logged by the watch. 

Overall, I am very pleased with the app, and it seems like they keep tweaking it and making it better each time.",0.80806
43,track your swims and achieve your goals,"The watch app is great. It's much more fully featured than apple's swim tracking app. 

However, the iOS software is pretty bad. The swimming stats are poorly organized, and the totals are usually incorrect. For example, any workouts from the current day don't apply to the weekly total.  Also, the charts are wrong (showing workouts which didn't occur). 

Please update the iOS app and fix the bugs!",0.5980713
44,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Have been using this app with an Appe Watch 2.0 for a few months and have seen steady improvements in what it can do. Appreciate being able to record the skills distances within a workout now. Did have some issues with breast stroke detection, but that seems to be better after current update. Would like to see calories and sharing out from mobile app like you can in web site. Great app!",0.80806
45,track your swims and achieve your goals,I had a Garmin swim before and hated constantly pressing the button to start and stop intervals. That this app automatically distinguishes between intervals and resting at the wall is the single best feature for me.

46,track your swims and achieve your goals,"The Apple Watch app is very reliable for auto-detecting sets (no need to push buttons:-) and strokes. It also has a very easy way to include drill/kicking sets. 

Overall, it's a great app for swimmers!

Suggestion: While HR data from the watch is not always accurate, it would still be useful to have that displayed with the rest of the workout stats.",0.81597215
47,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I really enjoy using this app with my new Apple Watch and the additional details such as split times, swimmers in my area, clubs, etc not available with Apple'a app. The UI needs a little more user flexibility as I had to contact technical support to change my location.

Otherwise great app",0.6608672
50,track your swims and achieve your goals,I didn't want to spend more money on the new AppleWatch to be able to swim.

- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. 
- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!",0.80806
103,track your swims and achieve your goals,"This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

Thanks.",0.64737046

106,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I'd give this a 4.5 if I could. It's not a perfect app, there are some things that could be changed (a more direct way to get to your active challenges, for one). However, it works well with pretty much any fitness tracker out there, syncs nicely with Garmin/Strava. The monthly challenges are very motivating. Making the progress bar for the challenges a bit more prominent would be a nice change, too. All in all, though, this is a great app for us swimmers.",0.80806

111,track your swims and achieve your goals,"For samsung wearable devices, this is the most accurate swimming app I have come across. Much better compared to speedo on and Samsung health. Works awesome with the galaxy watch. Only downside I have is that for some reason, once you launch the app it turns the watch brightness to max. Wish it didnt but It's not much of a big deal. On the gear 2pro, the display could use some tweaking though. You can't scroll through pages once water lock is on; it does not scroll automatically either.

Mostly this was seamless, but when it wasn't the support team was a big help. The support team is super. They are responsive and listen to suggestions well. This is the only app that I know of, where I can fix the mistakes that I made using my watch in the pool. I can also adjust when the watch reads my stroke wrong.

119,track your swims and achieve your goals,Just got a Google fit watch and this is the only app I've found that will work on it to track swims. Easy to use but remember to turn the app on before you start then log your results on the Google fit app it won't do it automatically like my old fitbit used to! Also it gives you alot of different stats like rest time but it won't tell you how many calories you've burned you need to work that out yourself. Overall a good app I just hope the devs make it even better!,0.80806

Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",0.7434068

However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets.

Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

You are building a very good tool and our requests are a testimony that we’re using it but want more. Very common in the software business.

- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths

- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. 
- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!",0.6774036
394,discover and create smart workouts,"This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

582,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",0.54607815
583,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets.

Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.",0.8440018

589,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line,0.8440018

593,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"My primary complaint is that the last lap appears to throw in a couple of seconds. One can check this by comparing the splits against the last. Now to work around this problem, I simply add another 50 yards to the interval and use the next to last split and final times. And it makes a better workout!

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

873,connect with other swimmers,"After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",0.1459135
874,connect with other swimmers,"They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets.

Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths

975,connect with other swimmers,"I’ve been using the swim.com app for more than a year and I like it a lot. There are however, a few points that could be improved:
- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. 
- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!",0.9909207
976,connect with other swimmers,"This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.

I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets.

Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths

- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. 
- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!",0.975211
1267,compete with swimmers,"This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.

I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5).

Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.
