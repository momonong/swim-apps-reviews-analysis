0,"After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",4
1,"Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple’s UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the “X” should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).

Lastly, this has a very social media feel to it in some places, especially as I was going through the privacy settings, so if that isn’t your thing (like it isn’t for me), make sure you turn your profile to private.",3
2,"They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets. 

Still, I do like the improvements they’ve made in the last few years. Keep working on it.",4
3,"At 70 yo I sometimes ( no, all the time) need motivation in these times to get up and do something healthy   Keeping track of my daily yardage and checking cumulative weekly, monthly and annual yards against others in similar age groups keeps me getting up early and driving daily to the Y.  Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.",5
4,"This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I’m part of a club team and we have “wall tap counters” (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you’re on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",2
5,"Installed this app because I was looking for some better views on my watch of laps, time, heart rate, etc when swimming. The Apple Workout app wasn’t cutting it for me. The watch views are exactly what I was looking for but I noticed after a couple swims that my active calories are significantly under reported compared to the Apple app. When comparing heart rate data from other workouts it seems this app is under reporting rather than other apps over reporting. The difference is significant for a 30 minute workout, about half the reported calories.",4
6,"I want to like this app. It has potential, and I’ve stuck with it for the past three years. Unfortunately, the bugs are overwhelming. Even something as simple as drill mode, where the app doesn’t need to do anything except what it is told by the user, fails to record proper distance and time. Not to mention the latest “upgrade” to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn’t work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What’s more, half of the time the workouts don’t upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features. Make the app solid and reliable first, then focus on upgrades.",2
7,I like this app because it’s the only one I know of that lets me edit back in my kick set yardage after the workout is done. There is no choice for a kick set in the editing section so I call them a drill. App worked well until recently then suddenly stopped uploading data to Apple health. After about one month an update was released and now everything is working properly again.,4
8,"Easy to use and manually add my yardage. I have a iWatch but can't figure out how to use it with this site
When I click the Leaderboard, it only shows I've done 75yds so I'm obviously doing something wrong as my 3x per week swims are close to 7,500.  I'm 67 yrs of age and since covid pandemic have been away from synchronized swimming so loving the pool again 
Not techi but at least I can manually enter my yardage
Reported my pool as having changed names and it was quickly corrected!   Thank you!",5
9,"The new iPhone app format update is the worst user interface I've ever seen. Lots of wasted space with useless bar graphs and useless lifetime totals, difficult to see your last workout data, and hard to read it when you find it. And a new focus on offering workouts but if you don't need them you're going to have to constantly navigate around that. The Apple watch workout app shows the real data a million times better. Hopefully they'll fix it because their Apple watch app is better than the workout one. 

Lastly, still useful from an old review:
There are no weekly totals, no analysis of improvement. If they improve all this stuff it could be useful.",1
10,Communicated with John who was very helpful. App has always correctly recorded times for me for the almost two years that I’ve used it. But one swim recently showed correct total time but recorded each length as exactly same time - obvious error. John guided me through a few steps and consulted with his engineer. Problem seems to have fixed itself. I appreciated John’s concern and his checking in with me later to verify app was working fine now.,5
11,This app is great when it works. Just after the new iOS update the app has been buggy and lost two of my swims. I️ like that it handles rest between intervals and sets. I️ also like to set the drill mode. The Apple Watch workout app tracks in the background and it adds to your rings.  Ending a workout can be a pain since the way the Apple Watch and app are relying on pressure. Did a 4000 yard workout with my masters group and the app locked up and lost the workout. It needs serious fixes and an update. May go back to apples fitness app which is harder to handle I️. The water for drill sets.,3
12,"I haven’t even gotten around to using this app in the pool because the interface/settings are extremely cumbersome. This app won’t save your preferences on workout searches; it defaults back to the preferences you input when you set up your account. I made the “mistake” of setting up preferences that turned out to be very restrictive and only showed one workout. If I want to search for a new workout, I have to change my preferences every time I navigate away from the Workouts tab. If I favorite a workout after fiddling with my preferences for the umpteenth time, I have to change my settings yet again when I want to view those workouts.",1
13,Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line,4
14,"This app works. I am not sure where all the complaints come from. It counts laps, yards/meters, shows heart rate in one place. The new redesign on AW is just perfect. Especially the color coding. The stats on phone seems to be a little “cluttered” but still show all that is needed. This review comes from a guy with over 40 years of experience swimming. To developers, keep up the great work. Thanks!",5
15,This has been happening to me in the past month at least one a week and I was hoping the new update would fix this but it happened again today and I lost all my data! I was doing a drill and I was ready to do my last 100 yards and I looked at my watch to check my pace and the app was back to the start as if I had not just swim 2500 yards.,4
16,"Only complaint is there’s no option to NOT put in distance. Sometimes I just swim for “time” and don’t count the distance. App requires a multiple to place in the distance box. I just put in a random number and then in the notes I explain what I did on this particular training day. Other than that, app is easy to use and very useful, especially for me as a “returning swimmer”, so I can measure my progress. Cheers!",5
17,"My primary complaint is that the last lap appears to throw in a couple of seconds. One can check this by comparing the splits against the last. Now to work around this problem, I simply add another 50 yards to the interval and use the next to last split and final times. And it makes a better workout!

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

You are building a very good tool and our requests are a testimony that we’re using it but want more. Very common in the software business.

As I mentioned earlier I would be happy to pay for this app so don’t stop!

And thank you!",4
18,I’ve used this App for 4 years and over the last year it has been crashing and dropping my swims halfway through my 3500 yard sessions. I regularly have to check and manually add 1300+ yard sets to accurately track my total distance. I submitted a report and they told me it was because I’m not running the current version (which I am on an Apple Series 6). Unfortunately this is the best tracker I have found so far so I deal with the crashes that have become a regular part of my training.,2
19,I like the app on the Apple watch 2 but doesn’t translate well to iPhone. The workouts usually take days to sync and the calories always show 0 even though my watch obviously picks up the movement. It just doesn’t equate to the same number of calories as the resistance brings when the watch knows that your swimming. Not sure I explained well but it’s frustrating. The only thing I like about his app is that it differentiates resting vs swimming time. Haven’t found another swimming app that does that automatically.,2
20,"More accurate than iSwimStat, and I compare it with a couple others but this doesn’t load quickly. It takes hours or even days to show up even though I refresh many times. Not sure if I’m using it correctly.  Synched with Apple Watch.",4
21,I like this app - it’s free and you can’t argue with the value for what it does (other apps charge you for stats/membership). The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is my being unable to put/list myself on leaderboard. Perhaps it’s just a learning curve - I’m using this app only for a 3-4 months. Do you know how I can fix that?,4
22,"In my opinion, the best app. It stops automatically, you have the possibility to record distance swam for drill mode (apple watch native exercise app does not offer this possibilty), you have the possibility to swim a set in a fixed amount of time (repeat in), which is another important feature that the native app does not have).",5
23,When it automatically syncs it is good but each year have problems with this. I love when it works correctly but not so much when it doesn’t. The service with issues of connectivity or syncing not much help. But it would be five stars if it worked correctly all the time.,3
24,"Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from regarding accuracy. This app comes within 50 yards of my 3000+ yard workouts, and gathers excellent data. The best part, however, is an easily accessible drill mode for kick sets. Best swim app available at time of this writing, and I’ve tried them all.",5
25,"After 3 years of using this app, I can say it covers all the needs of the swimmer and it keeps evolving and adding functionalities.

Unmatched and highly responsive customer support makes it even better.",5
26,"I have used this app with my Series 2 Watch, and it worked well. The user interface is great, and accounting for kick drills is excellent. 

It needs an update however for the new Watch iOS. I don’t blame the developer, but it needs to be addressed. Blows away Apple’s swim
tracker, when it works.

UPDATE:

I have uninstalled and then reinstalled. Still doesn’t work on Apple Watch Series 3. Developer is VERY responsive, which is appreciated, but still not working. Hopefully soon because it is an excellent app, when it works.

FINAL UPDATE:

I have done everything short of sacrificing a goat to get this app to work. I even reset my Apple Watch Series 3 to factory settings. After 200 meters, watch read 50. 

Done with this app forever. Great concept, but reality is much different. It just doesn’t work.",1
27,"I was really excited about this app, but it blocks out all relevant information and covers the face of my watch with just the time of day so it’s nearly impossible to figure out what my splits are or what comes next in the workout. I tried raising my arm, touching the screen, jiggling the Digital Crown, but nothing reliably called up the info I wanted to see. I finally gave up and went back to the watch’s built in lap tracker. Disappointing.",1
28,"Never had an issue with calorie transfer to health app until the recent update that was supposed to fix an issue regarding that. Said I burned 197,000 calories the first swim workout I completed since the new update. I have an Apple Watch 5 and iphone12 plus.",4
29,"Frequently adds laps, even for a 100 it may record 125. It also doesn’t correctly I’d strokes. Tech support doesn’t seem interested. I have the latest pre beta version with open water tracking, they told me all bugs were fixed. I use the latest “pre” beta version which I was told had the latest algorithms   Unfortunately I see the same errors as the previous versions",2
30,"Have nearly 900k yards tracked with only a handful of errors. Accurate tracking, consistent splits, and one button start/stop. On top of that, developers that listen and want to fix issues and constantly make this app better. Highly recommended.",5
31,"I had some issues with the Swim app on my Apple Watch a few years ago so I switched to Apple’s swim workout app -that is until Swim stopped loading the data (I think due to an Apple update)

Now that I’m using Swim again, I notice two problems. 

1) the calories count is about half what it should be on my 2250 yard swim, but agrees with Apple’s count on my 250 yard swim. 

2) I typically do a long swim (2250 yds) followed by a short (250 yd swim). My last 2 sessions (using the Swim app on my Apple Watch 3) only one swim would load on swim. 
One time the app crashed when I ended the longer swim.",4
32,"This app is exactly what I wanted!
-build swim workouts
-track swim workouts

4/5 stars because it’s very slow and communication with my Apple Watch is a bit glitchy. Couldn’t track this morning’s swim. Saw the update and downloaded it just now so hopefully that helps.",4
33,I like the app and the ability to have my workouts on my Apple Watch.  The connection between the Watch and app does not work and when it does then the app to the activity tracker does not work.  I have followed all the suggestions in the support but it’s still unstable.  Connection to the internet is not the problem.,3
34,"Downloaded the app and tried to create a new account by putting all my info in, but I clicked on create new account nothing worked.",5
35,The concept of the app is great and really needed as there is little support for swimmers.  I have had the app for a long time.  When it was launched I expected it would quickly start aligning with all the watches that support swimming metrics.  I support Polar who have been in the swimming space for a long time.  There is still no support for Polar or a raft of other watches.  If you want to grow your customer base surely appealing to a wider audience is a no brainer but I must be wrong!,1
36,"I bought my Apple Watch 6 last week. It only tracked 20 of 60 minutes in the pool. I’m starting out doing kickboard front/back crawls (no arms yet) and the tracking is wonky.

I just want to track my laps. I’m looking for the swim lap tracker for dummies. I don’t think this is it yet. I’ll try for another week but I’ll be honest. I’m looking still.",2
37,Great concept but the ease of use isn’t there. The app isn’t intuitive to use and is a bit behind the power curve when it comes to inputting your times. There is no option for tenths and it refers to your time as “duration.” I’m not thrilled with this at all. Did they use actual swimmers when running this thru testing? I can’t imagine they did.,2
38,"Some swim sessions are not being saved. Disappeared completely out of the box 😂
It gets me frustrated, especially after swimming 4kms 🤯
The new update of the app on the apple watch displays a weird layout sometimes, buttons and labels are getting outside of the screen 😳",3
39,"I am able to adjust date of swim, but it does not save. I forget to input day of swim occasionally so unfortunately my swim is posted day late. Hope the ability to do that is fixed. Also, many times I need to input info twice for it to save.",3
40,"It used to auto-import swim workouts from the health app, but for some reason they removed that feature. Now it’s back.",4
41,Great website to use for logging and viewing my swim stats,5
42,Apple Watch SE owner since October 2022. For some reason the app is overstating my distance in the water today I did 500 yards the watch record of 1200 yards however using the native activity app that comes with the phone My distance was recorded accurately. Any ideas?,3
43,The leaderboard feature is absolutely incredible! Couldn’t have asked for a better tracking device!,5
44,"To use this app for *anything* you have to turn over incredible amounts of personal information.  If you make any part of your profile “private” the app won’t work with any of the myriad of virtual events. The UI is an abomination and doesn’t work effectively with manual entries, making this YET ANOTHER “service” that requires a $300 watch. Very unfortunate that USMS has partnered with such a low quality venture.",1
45,Love building workouts and viewing them on my Apple Watch while swimming. Tracking accuracy is the best compared to other apps.,5
46,"When I complete a warm up the app will then say the workout is complete.  I have to continue the swim to continue to track the workout.  Overall, the app works well besides that glitch.",3
47,"I recently got back into the pool November 2020 and was very pleased that this app would log all of my swim workouts automatically but since Jan 3rd, 2021 it doesn’t recognize them. I’m not sure what to do to fix this problem. Please help!!!",3
48,"I was swimming with Garmin watches for a long time, and switch to Apple watch. I'm a technical person work the latest and greatest gadgets, and could not figure out how to connect your app to the watch (it did install it inn the watch). I have a five min rule, and off takes longer, you out (good thing took me less to figure out my Tesla).",1
49,"Not usable: will crash in the middle of a workout loosing all my work. Last time it crashed during my warm up 300 m. 

Had to go to the Watch app. Which does not have work outs and distance can be off but at least it does not crash. 

I want to be a happy customer again.",2
50,Use only the done button helps,3
51,Picked up swimming again and it really helps me track my progress!,5
52,"The old app prior to IOS 11 was great! HELP! The old app you gave lap number and accumulated time.....the new app is a step back ... please add these stats back to the app...say for a 1000 meter swim the old app displayed lap number and accumulated time. Thus I don’t know my accumulated times say for 200, 400 etc.....using the new app? Can you help? Thanks!",2
53,"Filters keep resetting and filtering favorite workouts out. Finding and creating workouts takes too long, and then you still have to jump through many hoops to find them. Hopefully they fix this soon.",2
54,"The core of the app works well. I swim about 10k a week, and the tracking works great with the apple watch.

The new update.... ehhhhh... what is the top section?! Filters dont seam to work correctly, harder to navigate... I hope track stays good!",3
55,"25 meter pool, the only workouts I could find were about 4 all freestyle. I was really hoping for kicking drills. The website doesn’t really function properly. Trying to find other swimmers at your pool, or just even setting your default pool Does Not Work. Lots of interesting ideas, next to no follow through on execution.",1
56,"I have use this app for a number of years. Early on I found it was fairly accurate, occasionally missing half a lap or so. I’m not sure what changed but right now the app is completely useless to me because it misses three or four laps at a time on a long segment. I’ve moved on to other apps that work better",1
57,"I find this app hard to figure out. Hard to turn off on my Apple Watch. 
Need some instructions as to what steps to do on the phone and watch to have it work the way it’s designed to. Not happy with it !",3
58,"This app has been unstable for years. Every time they make a change they break something else. 

The latest is that you can no longer count laps. Pretty basic thing to request. The developers obviously have no quality control. 

The app is also not private. And they share my location and name with others. I have no desire to have my name on a feed when my privacy is important to me. 

At the very least fix the app so it can count laps again instead of yards",1
59,The moment you swim the info on the watch is blurred out and only the time is shown. This is the main thing that makes the app useless and keeps it from being awesome. I don’t understand why the developer hasn’t fixed this yet,1
60,Joining challenges keeps me going back to swim. Updates are slow but great for tracking swims.,4
61,"For some unknown reasons, the app stop recording the activity about 10 min earlier than the actual recorded time. I could find a solution to this annoying issue. Writing to support did not yet produce any result",1
62,This app recently started crashing on my iPhone. I get about 30 seconds to view my workout and then it goes off. I deleted and reinstalled but that didn’t work. My Apple Watch and phone are both updated to the newest version.,1

- my records section. I want to see my best times for different distances. It is cool to show a badge for fastest 400 yard but what is that time record? I think you can see this on the site but I could not find in app. 
- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths 
- more workouts to do. Options seem pretty limited to shorter distances. Master swim classes will do a 1650 for warm up. 
- drill videos would be cool. I know they are available through you tube but it would be cool if they were here and built into the workouts.",4

111,"THIS APP IS SO GOOD AND LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE 

DOWNLOAD NOW!!!",5
112,blah,1
113,"I have Apple’s new Series 2 watch. 

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate. (not really necessary but since the data is there it'd be good to incorporate). Hopefully the app will be improved, I like the concept.",2
114,"At first I was disappointed that the app didn't count my breaststroke or kick sets, but the more I use it, I see that it's algorithm is learning my strokes and adapting its analysis. All my breaststroke is now counted accurately and is starting to sometimes give me credit for kick sets. 

Even if it never quite gets the kicks counted, the ability to sense the difference between swimming and resting and the stats (some of which you can access immediately) put this app head and shoulders above the others I've tried on the Apple Watch.",4
115,"Still a little buggy. I uninstalled, then reinstalled after the app crashed when I still had 20 laps to complete. It may have been the Apple Watch because the Apple logo appeared and I couldn't bring up any apps. I thought maybe the watch was downloading an IOS update or something. Whatever. It's just very frustrating. I lost all of today's data. Maybe my resistance gloves got in the way and pressed the stem. Other than that, I like this app. Some issues with lap count and stroke recognition though. Not a big deal for a casual swimmer like me.",5
116,"This app seems to have promise, but for this swimmer of quite modest abilities, it is not yet ready to replace my Garmin swim watch.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin. These should be basic features of any swim  watch software.

I will watch for software updates before trying again.",3
117,"I have just started using this new app for my swim routines and I can say that this is one of the better swim apps out there so far. I love being able to track my workouts and comparing lap times with my friends and other people who are using this app with ease. Not only that, just from using the app today, I found a few new local pools in my area that I didn't know even existed before! Now that the new Apple Watch is waterproof, this is my go-to swim app to use with it.",5
118,"Bought a new waterproof Apple Watch last week, been shopping for best swim app. My master swim mates recommended this app to me. Absolutely love it!!  Love the fact that this app not only can track my daily swim workout, but also allow me to connect with other swimmers.  The best feature is that I can locate the pool close by using this app. This is huge for me since I need to travel a lot because of work, this make my life much easier as I want to keep swimming every day.",5
119,"The app is slow and clunky with an unintuitive interface. Instead of focusing on giving us quick and easy access to our swimming metrics, this app seems to instead focus more on social stuff and finding swimming pools (which it isn't very good at) and it has the word ""unknown"" misspelled as well. Building a custom workout is actually way harder and slower than it should be, plus you constantly have to wait for the app to contact the servers because no one on the development team thought people might want to store their data locally on their phone. 

It's not terrible but it certainly isn't good.",2
120,"I've been using this app with my Apple Watch Series 2 for about three weeks. I have not tried to get super accurate information from it, but it does a very nice job of tracking my yardage and giving me a sense of how I was performing. 

The quick drill setup on the watch is an excellent way to capture those kicking yards that don't get logged by the watch. 

Overall, I am very pleased with the app, and it seems like they keep tweaking it and making it better each time.",4
121,"The watch app is great. It's much more fully featured than apple's swim tracking app. 

However, the iOS software is pretty bad. The swimming stats are poorly organized, and the totals are usually incorrect. For example, any workouts from the current day don't apply to the weekly total.  Also, the charts are wrong (showing workouts which didn't occur). 

Please update the iOS app and fix the bugs!",4
122,"Have been using this app with an Appe Watch 2.0 for a few months and have seen steady improvements in what it can do. Appreciate being able to record the skills distances within a workout now. Did have some issues with breast stroke detection, but that seems to be better after current update. Would like to see calories and sharing out from mobile app like you can in web site. Great app!",5
123,I had a Garmin swim before and hated constantly pressing the button to start and stop intervals. That this app automatically distinguishes between intervals and resting at the wall is the single best feature for me. This is also a big improvement over the previous version which required scrolling to see everything and crashed a lot.,5
124,"Drill feature is great, so I use this over the built in app. However anything I do fast over a 50 is counted wrong. Did last 4 times I've done a 100 fast I'll go in the 55-56 range it gives me a time of 1 minutes and says I only did a 75.  Same thing for the 200, only days I've done a 175.  Times are also off. It thinks I'm resting almost 5 seconds after I have actually finished.  Overall not terrible, drill mode is the only thing that keeps me using it since I can add back in those laps it missed.",2
125,"Apple's built-in activity app is very accurate for tracking distance and deducing stroke type, but it requires manually stopping its chronometer to check time on individual sets, save or discard the record and launch a new activity before a new set. Very tedious! 

This app has been very good at stopping the clock when I come to a rest and smart enough to reset the clock to zero before I start swimming again. Big thumps up! Unfortunately, its distance and stroke count is horribly inaccurate. At the moment, I can only use it as a smart chronometer.

It also nags about gaining access to health data numerous times a day. Very annoying. Ask once and stop bothering me for at least a week. 

Hoping for the bugs to be fixed or a better alternative app to be launched.",3
126,"The Apple Watch app is very reliable for auto-detecting sets (no need to push buttons:-) and strokes. It also has a very easy way to include drill/kicking sets. 

Overall, it's a great app for swimmers!

Suggestion: While HR data from the watch is not always accurate, it would still be useful to have that displayed with the rest of the workout stats.",4
127,"I really enjoy using this app with my new Apple Watch and the additional details such as split times, swimmers in my area, clubs, etc not available with Apple'a app. The UI needs a little more user flexibility as I had to contact technical support to change my location. Highly recommended, otherwise.",5
128,"This is a great app for swimming. I like that it captures my drill sets and also returns what I ""just"" swam. I gave it a four star because it's buggy and not working on my Apple Watch. I'm sure it'll get fixed quite soon. Give it a try. I won't be so quick to update, I'll wait on every other one. :)",5
129,"I'm happy with the app and website overall, but a few weeks ago the yards I enter in Drill Mode on my Apple Watch don't transfer to the app or website even though they show up on my watch.  It is basically a waste of time to use the drill mode since none of the yards show up.  I contacted customer service about this a few weeks ago and never heard any response.",3
130,"I use the app frequently and all works well and great!... until... i would say about 1 out 10 swims the screen gets activated and mess up the swim tracking. My last one it wiped out the whole work out. 

So i guess you can turn on the water protection, but then you can glance during swim on progress/time/heartrate... 

Otherwise great app",4
131,I didn't want to spend more money on the new AppleWatch to be able to swim. I bought a waterproof cover for my current Apple Watch and this app has helped me track my swimming. I'm also glad they added a drill component. This has been very helpful. You will enjoy this app.,5
132,"I find this app kind of spotty. For instance, it doesn't seem to capture different strokes mid workout. If I'm doing freestyle and switch to breaststroke it skips a lap or two before it picks it up. It also doesn't capture all my workouts although that could be a function of a recent update, that wiped out a couple workouts. In any case, I don't find it that much better than what Apple Watch gives you.",3
133,"I just returned to lap swimming and tried the app. It was accurate for distance, strokes and time. I wish it showed calories burned. Are you able to run the swim app and the Apple Watch workout app at the same time? The Apple Watch workout app doesn't display different strokes, but does measure calories.",4
134,I bought a watch specifically for the swim app and workout tracking and with every upgrade it seems to get worse. Now none of my workouts at all are displayed. Needs serious QE testing. Signed disappointed swimmer!,5
135,"When this app is working it's Awesome! It's accurate, it's user friendly, it does everything I was looking for in a swim app. I loved it!!
That's the Good. The Bad.
Lately its crashing. I've lost two swims.. one was almost complete for 3800 yards.. the other crashed twice during my swim.
The Ugly. Your customer support is 
Horrible!! It's been over a week and I've not heard a word. Are you addressing this problem? Do you even care? I'd give this app 5+ stars. 
It's that good.. but your customer follow through is awful! Please fix!",5
136,"I have never felt so disappointed about an app as this one. It glitches out and doesn't record anything every third to every other time I swim. I originally got this app for the stroke count and because it could differentiate between each set. I don't know what the purpose of using it is if it glitches out so often. Rest assured it will be deleted. FYI, this week out of the 5 times I swam, it recorded 3. DISAPPOINTING",1
137,"Pebble Time works great to track your distance during the workout. But syncing the Pebble to the app is Russian roulette. Every few work outs it will not only NOT sync the work out but will delete the workout too! Really frustrating when you are trying to track progress and use goals to motivate.

Really disappointed that they couldn't get this fundamental part of the whole app sorted out by now!",2
138,"After using this app for about a month, ~ 3 times a week, all performance measures noticeably improved. This has also reflected in swim style improvements that my co swimmers noticed. 

Highly recommend to all skill level swimmers.",5
139,"Since getting the new waterproof Apple Watch, I have been searching for a great swim tracking app.  This looked like it might be the one - until I discovered that there is. I way to tell the app about pools that it does not already recognize.  I swim in my own pool, and that means I am out of luck.  Seems like a very silly omission.",3
140,"I love the app, but consistently run in to issues with the app closing part way through my swim. This make it difficult to accurately track my workouts. 

I am running this on a 1st generation AppleWatch with a Catalyst, waterproof watch case. 

Hope they can create a more stable app.",4
141,Got my workout exactly right even the first time. Apple's workout app never did no matter what I tried. Allows to edit workout if needed (I could remove my experimental drill). Amazed!,5
142,Drill mode and send off timer took a bit of time to get use to but this has become my go to app for my swim workouts.  Best app I have found for Apple Watch for tracking Swim workouts.,5
143,"I have been using MySwimPro since mid Janurary 2017. I am 64 years old and use it daily from my Apple Series 2 watch. It does all I need it to do and I am sure more. I just needed it to count my laps but I can see other great information like elapse time, calories and pulse. I love this app.

I have not tried all the other great parts of the app. 

The support is excellent. I had a few questions and Adam Oxner replied that day. There was an app fix the next day. 

Thanks MySwimPro team.",5
144,"Great new app. As someone who loves swimming I appreciate having this new app a lot. The app is great but definitely needs some improvements.
Since this is a new app I am giving it 5 stars and will be waiting for new releases.",5
145,"Apple watch app froze the second time I used it, requiring me to uninstall and reinstall (which deleted my swim.) When I tried to add the work out manually, it required the facility (why?) but didn't have the facility in its database. All that said, it is a free app so you get what you pay for.",3
146,Counting laps was a pain and I would always loose my count in reaching my goal each day. Now with this app I don't have to worry about it as it know exactly where I am and how much I have done.,5
147,"I use this app all the time and really like it. The stats, number of laps, heart beat rate, everything gets counted. I only wish #of strokes would get back, disappeared after the update.",5
148,This app works great! I have had no issues uploading all of my workouts from my Garmin swim watch. I also like being able to connect with the other swimmers in my club.,5
149,"As a triathlete, this app allows me to track every single workout and is providing me with the details I need to check on my improvements. Highly recommended",5
150,"This app works great for my Apple Watch 2 for capturing all my swimming data, including drills when I'm not moving my arms. I like the detailed data breakdown, workout analysis, and accurate lap count.",5
151,"The interface and ability to record kick sets held a lot of promise. But, alas, during my first workout the app recorded 175 yards for my 400 yard warmup. It was flummoxed by my 100 IM, recording only 25 yards... I switched mid workout to the native activity/swim app and it accurately counted the rest of my workout. 
I'll be deleting this app. Maybe they will improve in the future. 
Also I am concerned that it does not water lock the watch.",1
152,"Great app, very well-rounded. One of the best feature is the pool finder and seeing other people tracking their progress. Tried some other apps and like this one the best.",5
153,"I've only used this app a couple of times, but so far I love everything it does. Very easy set up and use during my workouts. Check it out!",5
154,"Used it for the first time today. Great job logging the workout, easy to share and connect with others.",5
155,"App works great with Apple 2 watch. My favorite parts...ability to easily select different pool sizes, the fact that it knows when I'm taking a breather. Great app!",5
156,"Love that I can use my pebble time to track my swims, but syncing is a crapshoot. Probably 30% of the time sync fails and workout data is lost.  Workout info on phone is minimal - would be nice to have workout breakdowns like on the website. HealthKit integration would be nice too.",3
157,"An app for the Apple Watch that is 1. Accurate 2. Allows you to select the option to do drills as you are swimming 3. Is free 4. Is awesome. 
I absolutely  recommend this app!! Very satisfied!!",5
158,This app is great for keeping track of your workout and even motivates through friendly competition at your local pool. Works great with the new Apple Watch!!,5
159,"This is the best swim app so far. I can connect with other clubs and swimmer. Its nice to locate pools around you within the app. Finally, i can track my Swims. Cant wait to go swimming again ❤️",5
160,"So close to perfect. I could have rated it 5 but there is room for improvement in charts, export options, data sharing with other apps, etc.",4
161,Load up your pool of choice or find one. The apps knows the size of pool.  Starts when you start.  Counts the strokes.  Splits. All totals up.  Great for all levels of swimmers.,5
162,Love not having to count my laps. Or forget to record them! I have been more motivated to swim since using the app.,5
163,"Tried in a few swims. First swim seemed to routinely miss the last 25 off each interval. Couldn't accurately detect stoke type.

Next swim I start tracking, swim 400m and look at watch to see 75m. Using Apple Watch 2.

Interface is very slow and non native, forced to setup an account with a login system that disallows certain characters for email but allows you to create the account, just not login ever again. Password must be short and bad.

I would forgive those bits of tracking actually worked.",2
164,"Easy to navigate, with good tracking for my personal progress. Looking forward to using the leaderboard for motivation. Hassle free device pairing.",5
165,"This app seems to be early beta status.

1. Like other users, uploading is spotty at best.

2.  App is pretty limited on what you can log about workout.  Easier for me just to go to website on a pc.

3.  I use Pebble time, and accuracy on lap counting is pretty horrible.  I swim 1-2 miles per workout and it does not track well.  Drills and sprints seem to track better,  maybe because motion is more vigorous than my distance swims. 

Ill give it another month and update if they have managed to make something of this.",2
166,"Good way to track swimming activity. Knows when you're resting, which the Workout app isn't able to do.",4
167,I found Lapse are not counted accurately recorded. I tried using distance and lap count. Distance is more accurate. The Lap count recorded each length of 25 yards/meters as 1/2 lap. It also missed more laps than distance.,4
168,"Tracked my distance, laps and rest time very accurately. Plus transferred the data to the phone from my watch correctly!  Happy!",5
169,"Whether you're a recreational swimmer or a competitive one, this app does it all! Definitely a great addition to my training!",5
170,Unfortunately when you are done and try to upload the workout the app does not synchronize the data from Pebble. It's worth noting the watch app works amazing accurately but it is a shame the data cannot be uploaded to track your swimming activities,2
171,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The past three times it wouldn't sync, no matter WHAT I did. I followed instructions, but wouldn't sync the new workouts. I would LOVE to be able to count on this app to work. Hopefully they will fix it soon.",2
172,The app works well and is reasonably accurate on lap count. Fails miserably on breast stroke. I like the drill mode for kicking and use that to handle breast stroke failing. Wish the drill mode entry of length was better.,4
173,"The app is accurate on tracking, but cannot determine my location. I also cannot manually input my profile detail or even input the pool I visit. Seems if you do not live in the US  you can not make your swimming great again.",2
174,The Apple Watch 2 is decent for casual swimmers.  If you really want some detailed analysis of your workout this app is a no-brainer.,5
175,"Having used the Apple Watch app and now the Swim app, there is no comparison. Fantastic, easy to use and accurate.",5
176,Great app! Developers did a nice job at making this app flow beautifully on the apple watch.,5
177,"UI needs a little work, but it's the most accurate tracker of distance out of all apps I've used. It's made my new Apple Watch so much more useful for me.",4
178,"Enjoy using this tracker for my daily swims.  Like the data set shared between the app, my Apple Watch and the Health app on the iPhone.",4
179,"Love this app for my triathlon training when I'm in the pool. Stroke rate, Swolf, distance per 100. It has everything.",5
180,I'm new to swimming and this app is great to track workouts. Wearables are a huge plus when paired with this app,5
181,"Only supports tracking with one of a few, select devices. No manual entry option. It might be useful if you have one of the devices they support (except the pebble), but otherwise this app is useless. Deleted.",2
182,The app does a great job of tracking swims ( laps and distance) and the basic information. Uploads are fast when and if they happen. App seems to reset or shut off on occasion.,3
183,"Swam for 32 mins at home, but app adjusted for 13:48. Watch say 11:03 with resting time of almost 10 mins. I barely rested. 2 or 3 seconds between laps. While it beats the Apple Watch app, it's still inaccurate.",3
184,I use it with the Garmin Fenix 3 and found it accurate,5
185,Nice app! I like the social aspect and can't wait to get in the pool and start logging work outs.,5
186,I really enjoy tracking my progress and mileage.,5
187,Pretty accurate swim tracker.  Gets the job done.,5
188,Love this app on my Apple Watch as it does not stop every time I lift my arm !!,5
189,User friendly and very helpful! High five!,5
190,"I've tried this app twice, and both times it has reset after 500 meters. The 1st time it lost my workout completely. I emailed customer service, but never received a response sooooooo.... DELETE!!!!",1
191,App works great with the new Apple Watch. Stoked,5
192,"This app does not track distance well, nor does the time stop when one pushes ""end work"", nor does it sync your workout with your phone. It just does not deliver.",1
193,I wish there was a choice for swimming in a lake or an ocean. Currently I swim the same distance every time but it is recorded anywhere from 100 to 600 yards.,2
194,"Is a free app, detects the strokes (most of the times) detects the distance, and again... is free! Love it!",5
195,Not thrilled with this watch.  Inconsistent so not dependable for keeping track of swims.  Sometimes turns off halfway through a swim session.  Want a feature that will edit/delete.,1
196,Much better than swimpro,5
197,"As others have noted, the latest Pebble update seems to have broken the app. No workouts will sync and the data appears to just be lost.",1
198,I love this app! It does so much in recording my swims,5
199,I Haven't upload none of my trainings! I did just manually on the site! Getting worst each upgrade!,1
200,"This one tracks your distance, time and heart rate. The open water course is still a mess of spaghetti due to GPS  issues but still superior to the native Apple Watch program for open water. Pool swimmers will appreciate the workouts. It is FREE! If the GPS improves would rate 5 stars. All in all I really appreciate this app. Thanks to the swim.com team!",4
201,Horrible experience with the updated version of this app. It just doesn't record distance or laps properly. Junk.,1
202,"Even for free, don't waste your time downloading this. It's Very inaccurate and *Might* record 40-50% of your distance or laps. Support is non existent.",1
203,Hate apps that don't work unless you give out your Facebook or email.  They love to send you junk.  No matter how good the app. Not worth it,1
204,Can no longer upload workouts from pebble. Devs please fix!!!,1
205,It is reliable and fun to use.,5
206,Used to be a great app. Pebbles latest operating system upgrade renders this app completely useless. Won't upload any of my workouts,1
207,"Since the fitness club I swim at is not in the database, could not even set-up the first workout. Deleted.",1
208,"Uploads don't work, does not sync with pebble, no HealthKit integration, new version can't even count laps on pebble. Garbage.",1
209,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",3
210,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work. 

At this point between your faulty features and terrible customer service I'll wait to deal with one of your competitors that gets custom pool sizes into their app.",1
211,Good for me,5
212,Great,5
213,"Tried using it with my Apple Watch but it couldn’t tell when I ended a lap and I had to manually advance to the next drill. Didn’t log as a workout either in the swim.com app or apple workouts. 

Love the idea of getting workouts on my watch but not helpful if I can’t track my progress. Easier to just print out a workout and stick it on a spare kickboard.",2
214,I am not sure why my time on swim.com is faster than my time on my activity when I start there but the distance is the same. Great otherwise,3
215,"I’ve been using the swim.com app for more than a year and I like it a lot. There are however, a few points that could be improved:
- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. 
- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!",4
216,"I got this app to track open water swims. As stand-alone app, it’s quite good. Distance is much more accurate than with Apple Watch, and it even includes breast stroke distance, but calories only appear in iPhone fitness app after a lag, and don’t count towards daily move goal. Distance appears to be the inaccurate Apple Watch measure. Also, there’s no information about strokes swum. 

I’ll wait until these bugs are fixed before using swim.com to track my swims.",2
217,"The most annoying thing about the swim.com app is that if you don’t enter the challenges on the day that they start… all swims prior to when you enter the challenge do not count EVEN if they were swum during the challenge duration time. For example… challenge goes from sept 02-October02, you swim on the 2 and 3rd but don’t see the new challenge until the 4th.. TOO BAD those yards don’t count for the challenge. There should be a way for swim.com to remedy this. It makes swimmers discouraged to sign up for the challenges.",3
218,"I have used swim.com for many years and now it has been more of an irritant than anything else. Swim sets freeze up, drills are inaccurately reported from the watch to the phone and many lost swim sessions because the software just crashes on the watch. I have updated everything and your software continues to be very problematic. Unfortunately I’ve been using it for about 10 years and really enjoyed it until now. I have sent number of support emails to the appAnd they have not responded. Really disappointed and with swim.com",2
219,"While the app seems work accurately in the pool, I've had several problems. First, I signed up with an account with my Appl Strava manually. Files aren't recognized. I fine ID through the app. However, the browser version has no option to sign in with Apple ID. I emailed support about that, but I've still received no response after a week. Also, after multiple attempts and consultations with their support blog, I can't get it to export to Strava automatically. Then, when I tried to export FIT files manually, Strava wouldn't recognize the files. I then opened a new account with my email address so I would be able to login through the browser. I then tried to import the workouts from my other account, but Swim.com didn't even recognize its own FIT files created by their own app. It seems like this app isn't being kept up to date, and their support department has gone AWOL.",1
220,"This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

Thanks.",4
221,"Since going mobile and making the website non-functional, Swim.com is less and less appealing. It has limited functionality and access to less information. Why not do both, the website is up but removed access to workouts. Easier to compare workouts on website.",1
222,Good. Never opened or used but I rlly love it BEST APP EVER !!,5
223,I am getting into swimming and I love the Swim.com Leaderboards. I also tried other apps but the swim tracking was not as accurate as Swim.com’s proprietary tracking algorithms. Love it!!,5
224,It is accurate with yardage and stroke recognition. I like the drill and pace function. My biggest issue is the poor data transfer back to the iPhone app. Sometimes it works and other times it will not transfer back to the phone. I have tried most swim tracker apps and like the swim.com watch interface.  This app is the only one that has insistent issues with data transfers. When this is fixed I’ll start using it again.,3
225,"I love this app because the swim.com leaderboard has inspired me to swim an incredible distance, over 4000 km in two years. I have moved up from 271 to number 2 on the worldwide total distance leaderboard. 

I love this app because I can look at workout statistics after each workout that is uploaded to swim.com. 

I hate this app because it randomly refuses to upload  my workouts from my Apple Watch to swim.com app on the phone. Surprisingly, it will upload those workouts to the apple activity app for total distance only. But then I get no credit for the leaderboard on Swim.com. By my I have lost up to 100 km of leaderboard distance credit this way. 

I hate this app because the feature of leaderboard filter over specific time periods eg distance last week, last month, last 2 months, etc. has never worked. 

I hate this app because I have contacted swim.com multiple times about these issues. While the written responses are very friendly, nothing is fixed. 

There is so much promise to this app if it would just be tweaked to work better.",3
226,"This app worked great for me for about a month. I love the drill function as I do a fair amount of kicking and one armed fly drills. And the planned workout integration is nice for more advanced swimmers. My only suggestion would be to allow more data integration into the activity app so you can see sets there (like you can if you use the Apple Watch Workout app). But just a suggestion as the Swim.com app does allow this. 

Then the swim.col app stopped syncing with the health app. My privacy settings are set to allow the swim.com app to write and read the motion and fitness data. My sources are all setup in the health app. Nothing syncs. Started suddenly and for no apparent reason (no iOS or app updates happened between when it was working and now). I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling all sorts of apps. Restarting the phone and watch. Hard restarting the phone. Even restoring my iPhone. No dice. The biggest problem for me is that I no longer see a workout logged in activity app. I get the exercise credits because my heart rate was up, but no workout is logged. 

I have contacted the app developers several times. No response. I will have to stop using this app and start using the workout app. And manually logging kicking yards. I’d really much prefer to not do this, but oh well. Perhaps it’ll start working at some point. Tomorrow I am going to try running both apps and see what happens.",2
227,I have used this app with my old Apple Watch Series 2 and tried again with the Series 4. It continues to overestimate my laps. The native Apple Watch swimming app and MySwimPro are and have been both spot-on when it comes to counting my laps and distance. Not sure what the issue is with the Swim.com app and it’s a shame. I really wanted to use this app for my pool swimming.,2
228,I want to use this app. I love swim.com and use it to track workouts. I have to export and upload from the default Apple application. The app only properly detects crawl and will not count breaststroke and leaves big gaps in the workouts.,2
229,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",2
230,App.has gone from functional to brick. Says it cannot connect to server.,2
231,"It's January now and I haven't been able to sync between my Pebble and this app since August, and I've tried all kinds of gyrations to try and get them to sync. Now it is much WORSE. I just updated the Pebble part of the Swim duo and it has completely taken over my watch. I kill the swim app and it comes back before I can get to any other menu item, so I can't even reboot the watch. And this version still asks to be made my Activity app every.single.time.it.runs no matter that I keep saying no. If it was a person, we would call that a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The ONLY reason I keep using is because the stopwatch digits are big and easy to read while I'm in the pool and not wearing my glasses.",1
232,"I was very excited about this app, but it's totally unreliable. While it did work multiple times, when I used it to record my most important swim of the year (a 5.2km open water swim) on Galaxy watch 5, it failed to sync/upload the data. The data is there with an upload button, but it gives ""upload unsuccessful"" every time. I contacted support, but they were totally unhelpful: their recommendation was to manually enter total time/distance (and accept losing all pace & heart rate data).",1
233,"I'd give this a 4.5 if I could. It's not a perfect app, there are some things that could be changed (a more direct way to get to your active challenges, for one). However, it works well with pretty much any fitness tracker out there, syncs nicely with Garmin/Strava. The monthly challenges are very motivating. Making the progress bar for the challenges a bit more prominent would be a nice change, too. All in all, though, this is a great app for us swimmers.",5
234,"I would love it if it was accurate. I am not sure if the problems come from my swimming style, the software, or the hardware (using a Fossil Carlyle). In addition, I would love to have the following features: - the ability to manually edit/delete swimming logs (to help correct accuracy) - clear documentation on how to connect to Google Fit ( I see the option within account settings but haven't figured out how to use it) - ability to pause workouts (improve UX to make it easily discoverable)",2
235,"Syncing with a watch is a horrible experience. The login page does not come up every time on my phone. I've tried opening the Swim app on my phone and the WearOS app. But could only get the login screen to come up once. Then once it came up, found it the login screen doesn't include integration with my Google account. Had to delete my account and use a regular email account. Now I can't get the login screen to come back up.",2
236,"It's simply has too many issues, the watch app freezes and is a massive battery drain, the phone app freezes, and the website doesn't aggregate and average the daily, weekly and yearly distances. You have no idea what I have to go through to get the swims logged. I wish I was better at Excel and I would write a program myself.",1
237,"Overly obsessed with what pool you are in. It interferes with basic functionality. Also doesn't sync with Google fit, just allows you to export data that can be imported. Waste of time and effort.",2
238,"I have and use both a Garmin and Suunto sports watches (and Strava), and my swim data transfer seamlessly to this app. The app gives nice and clear visual display of your swim statistics, and is very easy and intuitive to use. However, I should perhaps point out that I'm only a recreational swimmer, so my needs are definitely satisfied way sooner than some pro's.",5
239,Terrible I can't even sign up because it says please accept the terms and conditions but doesn't give me the option to accept. So I can't even try it. I'm sure it's not good if you can't even create an account.,1
240,"The app is OK to use, but it has horrible support for units. There are several options to change the units from miles to meters. But so far I found not a single screen where the units are actually correct like I set them. I have it set to meters, and everywhere you can see ""y"" (probably ""yards"") where it should say ""m"". This is the same for the app and the smartwatch interface. Very annoying if you live in a country where they don't use retarded units. Contacting their support didn't help.",2
241,"All in all the app is great app with potential to be even better. The problem is the tracking accuracy! It never gets the tracks right. Whenever I go for 100yards, it thinks it was only 75 and my results look bad. When I correct it in the app, I find that one of the returns was usually not tracked. When I split the track to the correct number my results are not updated to the leadership board. I wonder how many users have that problem too and thus don't even make it into the leadership board?",2
242,"Inaccuracy is really an issue, especially when I don't see any logical reasoning. Out of 4 routine swims, three were not right in distance, none of the four were correct in identifying strokes nor the change in laps. Also, syncing with Google Fit is useless. 2 heart points after a 1km swim without being able to edit is just wrong! Your app also thinks I rest half of my swim time. Time for the team to invest in app accuracy and take a break from making up workouts!",2
243,"I can NOT recommend this app (for watches) & customer service/help desk I have had tried to connect my watch and it won't. I contacted the help desk -who seemed to be very helpful initially, however it has been over a month and I have not heard back (I have sent 2 follow up emails) it appears they have just put it in the 'too hard' basket. Very disappointed. If you want to track your swims I can HIGHLY recommend form swimwear, they have EXCELLENT customer service and I have had zero issues.",1
244,It works! I've been wanting a swim tracking wear OS app for a while. And now one exists. I imagine the developers had to work hard to get a swimming app on Wear OS 2 but they did it. I'm happy!,5
245,It's wary good app I very love it but I want to ask 2 improves 1 they I can set thet all kilometer/half kilometer I get short vibrate 2 some times one I stop for second in the middle of the pool because someone thet calculate it like 2 pools thenks 🙏,5
246,"Generally good. There seems to be an issue with the way the app estimates energy spent swimming. Today I swam 1700m and the app reports to Strava that I expended 30,000 calories? Weird.",4
247,"For samsung wearable devices, this is the most accurate swimming app I have come across. Much better compared to speedo on and Samsung health. Works awesome with the galaxy watch. Only downside I have is that for some reason, once you launch the app it turns the watch brightness to max. Wish it didnt but It's not much of a big deal. On the gear 2pro, the display could use some tweaking though. You can't scroll through pages once water lock is on; it does not scroll automatically either. All in all, It's a great app and would highly recommend it.",5
248,I like the workouts too much because it go with u in the water in the watch and be as coch swim beside u I just want more workouts for beginners Between 1 and 1.5 km during 45 to 60 minutes,5
249,"I liked the app when I was just tracking my swims but when I started wanting to use the workouts I got incredibly frustrated. All of the workouts are in yards even though I specifically have it set to meters, ok fine I thought, I can just create my own workouts... Well technically yes, but if you don't swim it immediately well then it disappears. There is no way to save it, other than send yourself a PDF of it but I DO NOT WANT A PDF! If I wanted a PDF I would have just typed the damn thing!",1
250,"Having tested for a couple of weeks, here are my impressions: 1.) Much better detection than S health with the galaxy watch. 2.) Freestyle, fly and backstroke are detected accurately, but breaststroke is not captured at all in my case, whereas it is with S health. 3.) I am finding myself having to re-athorize synchronization to Google fit after every swim or it is not synced. 4.) Ideally implementing synchronization to S health would be great to avoid using Health Sync.",3
251,"I have used this app to record swims, manually, through my USMS FLOG, and from my Swim2 watch through Garmin Connect. Mostly this was seamless, but when it wasn't the support team was a big help. The support team is super. They are responsive and listen to suggestions well. This is the only app that I know of, where I can fix the mistakes that I made using my watch in the pool. I can also adjust when the watch reads my stroke wrong. This is the go to app for looking at what I actually did.",5

Very little information on potential trouble shooting and no fallback solution, e.g. option to download/install previous version.",1
253,"App is the best available swimming tracker for Wear OS. But it’s not great, especially compared to tomtom or garmin. Accuracy is poor, rest feature may not recognise beginning of the swim.

254,Great app. Love the option to do pre-loaded workouts or simply record your swim.,5
255,"A good 10% - 20% out on every swim. Sometimes over, sometimes under, with no rhyme or reason. Inaccurate nearly to the point of uselessness. Interface is annoying and glitchty. It's impossible to see the lap count when you've got goggles on.",2
256,"I must be missing something because I am finding no value to this app. It's not syncing with my Garmin connect, the workout selection is a bit subpar, it feels very redundant. I'll just stick with the Garmin platform because there's no way I'm buying a watch just for swimming when the app isnt great. Two stars for trying",2
257,"All I want is swim tracking. Strokes, rest times, number of laps and distance traveled. Initially I was having trouble with accuracy. I had terrific response from the app developers. The app is getting better and better and better. Thanks",5
258,"Good start. Long way to go. Ease of use is OK (long lists of swimmers show v bad performance) . It's really a swim log viewer app rather than providing anything insightful. Analytical aspect is very weak. Needs to show progress over time such as best times (not just average) for various distances so you can see if you're improving and by how much. I'd like to see, by distance, my 1st 2nd 3rd best times. And for any set I'd like to see where it ranks for me by time (day, week, month, year).",2
259,"Doesn't record all your swims even though the same swims are documented on other apps. I just swam yesterday and it didn't log on this app, but logged to Garmin and Strava just fine as usual.

263,"Excellent swim app, calculates your stroke automatically and easily adds drills. It would get five stars but for the following 2 points. There have been isolated issues where workouts have not uploaded from the watch and also, a useful addition would be a calorie burn number.",4
264,"Swim app was absolutely great on my Galaxy Watch 1, having recorded around 40kilometres of pool swims....however it is utter rubbish on my galaxy watch 4. The menus have all changed and are a mess. Did a swimmer write these menu screens? I think not.

265,Stopped working on the Fossil Gen 5 all of a sudden. Had to reset and now the watch is not compatible. I had a lot of swims saved and now I can't track them any longer. And now it's fixed. Better communication would help but thanks for the fix.,4

270,Just got a Google fit watch and this is the only app I've found that will work on it to track swims. Easy to use but remember to turn the app on before you start then log your results on the Google fit app it won't do it automatically like my old fitbit used to! Also it gives you alot of different stats like rest time but it won't tell you how many calories you've burned you need to work that out yourself. Overall a good app I just hope the devs make it even better!,4
271,"Latest update seems to have broke it a bit on Galaxy Watch 4, seems to only be recording half my swim. Looks like it just stays in resting when you restart occasionally. Oddly its more accurate for initial lengths by seemingly recording less when it used to over estimate but you could just merge your lengths back down.",2
272,"Incredible pairing with Google Pixel watch. Stroke recognition is right about 75% of the time. In the app, you can adjust anything it didn't get right to make your workout history accurate. Honestly this app has motivated me to swim more.",5

274,"It is not perfect. I swim only freestyle and often times it says I am swimming another stroke, usually backstroke. It also misses lengths if I cool down with breaststroke. Today it added a length I did not swim. For the most part it does OK. I use a Gear Sport. It also would be nice if it hooked up with Samsung Health.",3
275,"So far best app at tracking laps with gear fit2pro. Measures laps accurately. Has drill mode to help pacing laps with vibrations. I only wish it could pace strokes. Browser UI clear, all the stats are there as graphs and tables and details up for editing.",5
276,Unfortunately with the latest Android 10 and version of the app/tinzen is very buggy. I can no longer reliably enter and exit water lock mode when switching between drill mode and swim without app getting stuck between swiping screens on galaxywatch. App then crashes and swim data is lost.,3

290,"Not very accurate but only option on Wear OS at present. Needs to be better though at just the basics of knowing whether I'm swimming or resting, and assuming if I'm moving in a 25m pool that after 4 minutes swimming I've probably done more than 50m!.",3
291,Great app to track your own swimming workouts and excellent user interface on smartwatch Galaxy 4,5
292,The app does accept feeds from Garmin Connect and maybe even Strava. The app created a location for me that I am unable to modify. The app created a 27 yard pool for me (my regular pool is SCY). The app tried to link to my USMS account but could not/would not accept my email address for the link up.,2

303,Pretty simple to use. Counts the laps accurately. Love the ability to do sets of a workout. Samsung watch vibrates to let me know when to go.,5
304,I'm not sure how much useless this can get. want me to open apple on phone to pair but no pin number. if you have a Samsung wearable use speedo on. at least you can record you lengths when swimming. this app is beyond help it all went wrong in han then update it got even worse. my pairing cider us a letter and 3 dots. submit ticket and theñ......,1
305,I was looking for the workouts feature but there's not much to see. It synced only one of my swims with Garmin connect. This can totally beat myswimpro just by adding default workouts.,3
306,Highly inaccurate at tracking number of lengths. says I've done way more than I have. Complete faff to end swim as well as the back button also activates Samsung Pay.,1
307,Can't fault it really. And it syncs Strava. Thankfully it runs in the background as Samsung Health doesn't and needs to be on the screen. I would rather this on display but Samsung is rubbish.,5
308,An excellent swimming application. It will carry out all of your requests. I enjoy the Send to Device feature since it makes choosing a workout on my watch faster. 💫,5
309,No settings tab. Cannot add my wearable - menu is greyed out.,1
310,"Love using this app for swimming much better than samsung health. Only problem I have is the app puts the full brightness up on my Galaxy Watch 46 so every time I end a swim I have to turn the watch brightness back down, apart from that it's great.",5
311,"Great app, works flawlessly on my TicWatch Pro 3 GPS. Accurate and also has heart beat, both of which the default app couldn't do! One suggestion, dark mode on the phone app would be nice #nitpick only!",4
312,I'm using swimming to get fit and lose weight. This app and the app for the galaxy watch really helps push me to my max and makes me want to do better each time I swim. Without it I would have given up by now. So thank you!,5
313,The new wear os integration is a massive improvement. Nice work. Still doesnt seem to link that well to Google fit. But im sure thats fixable.,4
314,"With the galaxy 4 watch, the app either does not count laps at all, or it looses the whole workout when you turn off the water lock to stop the workout.",1
315,"Doesn't track workout on galaxy watch 4. Difficult to get workouts to sync to watch, then deletes them when you turn off the water lock.",1
316,"Awful UX on the app. Even worse on the wear os app. Has dropped 3 / 7 swims, never synced never to be seen again. Algorithm is awful and always gets my swims wrong by 25m.",1
317,I have really been enjoying this app and tracking my open water feed. I am super excited about the new update today that shows open water leaderboards This will really make virtual competitions and personal tracking so much easier,5
318,"The update messed up the data vizualisation, which was not great to begin with, but now it's shown somehow reversed. Please fix.",2
319,"To hard to use. You can't just track your stroke on any pool, and you can't add a new one coz location option is broken.",1
320,Didnt even get to use it. Once installed it took over the screen on my watch. Only way I could stop it was to restart my watch. I opened up the app and it did exactly the same this. I have unstalled it,1
321,This app is fantastic...I love being able to edit my swims. My galaxy watch 3 is not the most accurate but I can merge my lengths easily..gives good overall swim info.,5
322,"Tracks swim well on watch, but functionality there is very limited - can't upload some activities and no way to delete them (and clean up) on watch.",3
323,I log a swim (no watch) and change the time and the app changes my distance. I can either have correct time or correct distance not both.,1
324,"This just doesn't work on my Fossil Gen 5. Installed on my phone and watch, but could NOT get them to communicate. Though I was logged into the App, the watch just kept saying to Log In or Join. Tried multiple times before giving up.",1
325,"Terrible, When attempting to sign up - you have to enter your age, the only way to do it is by moving one month at a time, I am 50 - 2010-1973=37x12= 444 - tap the screen 444x just to enter my age, you've got to be kidding me 🤷🏻 I uninstalled the app",1
326,I really like the metrics of the app. And I find it more reliable for stroke counts and ease of use than the native swimming app in the Galaxy Watch.,4
327,"It took a little while to get used to it, and I don't think it's always accurate, but it's still really handy and fun to use. At first it didn't recognize my breast consistently, but I got more careful with technique and it works!",5
328,"I love the app. Beautiful design, useful stats that give needed info for a workout analysis, interesting challenges. I recommend this app to my friends.",5
329,"Update March 14/22: the WearOS app on the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is now working just fine. Needed to turn on ""Allow Background Activity"" for the app in the Wear app on your phone. I'm back to loving this app!",5
330,"The app works and measure the strokes, but I have an issue with the meters. It remain counting meters although I am resting o still floating in the same place.",4
331,Works well for sustained swims. Seems confused by intervals with varying effort. Ignores kick sets altogether.,3
332,I have a galaxy watch 5 pro and the latest swim apps installed. Swam 1375 yards then the app crashed the wearOS and lost all my workout data. Did the same thing yesterday after 500 yards. It happened during swimming,1
333,"Will not pair with the galaxy watch. You enter the code and it just hangs before taking you back to the same screen asking for the code, and the watch says pairing failed. useless.",1
334,great app which is for free and have all features as the commercial apps. Counts the laps very accuratly (25m and 50m pools) and recognisizes the swim stlyle. Im using Samsung Gear Fit2,5
335,"After Speedo shut down, I have been looking for a decent open water swim app. This one is hopeless on the Gear S3. It keeps recording my open water swims as 1 or two laps of a pool.",1
336,"Does not record the lengths properly. Sometimes records I have completed 2 when I infact swam 1, use to be fine but lately not good at all .",3
337,Ii have used this app for years and it's never missed a lap. Upgraded to new Samsung 4 classic and today's swim was out by about 15 laps! Not sure if watch or app to blame :),3
338,love the accuracy and stats. now if there is a way to get a workout loaded it would be perfect.,5
339,"The app need to optimised in order to record the real distance. In my case, 10% to 15 % of the recorded distance is not real. Comparation made with Form Googles.",3
340,Very user unfriendly. Since it's the only app I can find that tracks my laps while swimming I stick for now.,1
341,"Very difficult to end App. Lost all my info on 1 swim. Did 20m and showed I did 120m very frustrating try to end swim, do much do, I am deleting.",2
342,App is pretty good. Functional but a bit clunky w/ sync between watches and app on phone.,3
343,Great concept if it worked. App will freeze around 1000 yd and you'll lose your swim workout. Happened with my galaxy watch 4,2
344,"Really happy to find this app. Just getting back to swimming after 40 years and needed something to keep me from getting bored and setting some goals. And, it's free!",4
345,Wear OS app is fantastic! Thanks for providing Strava integration and ability to specify smaller pool sizes (14 yards).,5
346,"The best app to follow the sport activities. Besides swimming, it also log on more activities: Running, cycling, yoga.... Great!",5
347,The Strava integration stopped working! Works perfectly on my Galaxy Active. It gets the meters and strokes very accurate as any garmin or suunto,5
348,"Probably an issue with wear os or my watch, but it rarely counts the distance correctly and always needs to get resynced with Google fit",3
349,This app works great with my Garmin. It takes very little effort and I know that it's accurate when it uploads to the system.,5
350,Is the best swim app I've tried . Only 8issue 8s after I have finished swim and stopped app it remains on my samsung gear screen so I have to turn watch off and on .,4
351,"great app, but often incorrectly measures distance. Over the course of 2km app can be up to 3 laps out (150m)",3
352,"1. The pool location is only show for pool in hotel. It should show outside hotel as well for example in the arena. 2. Can't edit title 3. Can't add province/address ( fyi : I'm in Jakarta Indonesia) Hope you can tell me if i'm wrong thanks, Ronald",3
353,"Really nice to have a stroke log, and it seamlessly ties in with Garmin Connect app, so it's nice to have for post swim eval.",5
354,A lot to improve features. More facile app and of course supporting unicode characters.,3
355,This app is amazing. Using the workouts in the app has helped me really focus on improving various parts of my swim.,5
356,"Swam for 30 minutes, but the app only recorded 175 meters. Wildly inaccurate (Fossil Explorist gen4), and therefore useless.",1
357,"this is a great app dont get me wrong, but if i accidently add a set to a workout im creating, i cant delete that set, or maybe you can and i dont know how",3
358,"Best swim app providing meaningful metrics. Pity they do not support Fitbit Versa watch, had to buy Galaxy Gear Sport to use and scrap my Versa.",5
359,"GOOD App..Captures Every Lap...Great Grafics..connected to Goggle & FB account..Records my swimming like January to December.. Every day is Sunday (it's Commplement)..I Feel Motivated to exel & Go Further..,Honestly Google Play Achievement point Motivate extra..so 👉👈 Overall Enjoyable & Worth Trying..& Exprinceing it..",4
360,Downloading issues with Samsung Gear Sport watch.,3
361,is not accurate at all!,3
362,this has worked really well for me. it counys my laps and measures my swolf. i had some issues but the delevoper helped me righy away. great service!,5
363,"Disastrously designed. No way to ask for help, or figure out how to solve problems yourself. Don't be like me, wasting hours trying to get USMS challenges to work when they didn't work right away.",1
364,Doesn't save swims - says they upload then are nowhere to be found. Cannot even see them in history of swims.,1
365,I am giving this three star because I cannot track my swim. when I finished it says 0 yards and put zeros on everything please improve this it's very disappointing,3
366,Good app. It would be great if the data transferred on to samsung health automatically!,5
367,"Tracks and stores pool swim practice info. Tracks and stores open water swim info. Join groups and participate in virtual competition. Compare to other swimmers by age, gender and type. Filter results by pool, group, time period. Distance total and timed swims by stroke and distance. Download and follow practice sets from device during swims.",5
368,It's a good attempt but very off on the actual distance completed. I swam a 200yds and it recorded 75yds,2
369,Couldn't get past the sign up page. Just tweaked out over and over tried reload etc. Android Phone 2022 moto g stylus 5g,1
370,"The watch app on Samsung Active2, crashing continually. I love the app when it works properly",2
371,"Connected with gear fit2 pro. lap count, distance, duration, pace, strokes, HR etc. but where is the start time and end time, calorie burned?",4
372,"Can't connect watch app to mobile app, it keeps sending me to play store even though latest app installed on watch and phone",1
373,"i like it but i miss the hr values/calories burnt calculation, because my watch allows live hr during the activitie (fit gear 2 pro).",3
374,I use the app with the Galaxy Watch. it awesome and seems to be accurate to 50m over 1500m.,5
375,"The pebble app still works great, but the android app has dropped the ability to upload swims.",1
376,Do not save data to app from Samsung galaxy watch 3 after swimming. Drill battery very much.,2
377,This seems pretty accurate but can this be paired with Samsung health so the workouts are added to others on there ?,3
378,Doesn't work on my Fossil Gen 6 watch. It only records between 4-6 minutes and between 25-225 meters in total.,1
379,Great app. Hopefully someday it will sync naturally with Samsung Health.,5
380,Every swim I did registered on my Fossil Gen 5 but then vanished straight away. 4 times in a row. Nothing online for support. Very disappointed....,1
381,This app is terrible for logging your times. It's strictly meant for you to share times with others.,1
382,Easily the best swimming app for Android. Works with my Pixel Watch too!,5
383,Never drops lengths or randomly stopping like the Samsung app on my watch.,5
384,Does not work with Galaxy Watch 4. Simply do not start recording the workout.,1
385,"The workouts are not there anymore, all filters are empty",1
386,Has trouble with pebble watches. Used to work but has trouble now.,3
387,Great app that tracks my swims and helps to keep me motivated..,5
388,Works well on Galaxy Watch 4 tracking lengths in indoor pool. Linking well to strava.,5
389,One of the best apps that I have used so far. Really good and has good workouts,5
390,It only detects freestyle and never detects breaststroke.,3
391,Poor. Even with all the filters open no workouts shown,1
392,"Easy app keeps data, user friendly & does what you want",5
393,Make sure you can count lengths and work out your distance because this app can't!,1
394,Everything is fine. Sometimes it couts courses improperly but we can live with it,5
395,Will not log me in. It acts like it's loading my profile and then freezes.,1
396,Unable to connect Gear Fit2 pro. Frustrating.,1
397,Works great. Helps me transfer my swim data from garmin to google fit.,5
398,First swim it recorded nothing....2nd swim recorded 60yds instead of 600yds. Samsung Gear Sport. Going to install Speedo and hope for better :(,1
399,the app could not even track anything with my Galaxy Active watch.,1
400,able to customize so many aspects of workout tracking,5
401,simple to use and good interface,4
402,"What an idiot made app for fit2 pro, impossible to shutdown. No stat I see on phone app. Very bad!",1
403,Great for tracking my swims even without a GPS watch,5
404,Accurately records laps. Data is great,4
405,Great tracking app with a Samsung Gear Fit Pro 2.,4
406,Good app for workouts and challenges,4
407,"Easy to use app and navigate, keeps me in check on my progress",5
408,This app is pretty accurate in detecting my swim workout,5
409,Love the app... Finally an app that tracks my swims accurately,5
410,Accurate lap counts. Good interface,5
411,Superb app thanks,5
412,"works well, almost no missed laps",4
413,Amazing display of all stats! 😍,5
414,Workouts are not working. I did everything that I could do but it doesn't work,1
415,Cannot change to metres Too complicated to use app with Syrava,1
416,Great app better than garmin 1 for swimming,5
417,Suddenly cant pair watch app to phone app,1
418,Reliable and interesting results,4
419,Won't let you log a swim at some point. - useless,1
420,Doesn's work on Wear OS 3.2 (Fossil sport),1
421,not user friendly. no provisions for open water swimming.,1
422,Sometimes doesn't sink swims from watch.,4
423,Works great in pixel watch!,5
424,As a beginner this is easy App to use.,4
425,I have 1 prob i dont have a smartwatch can i still use the app?,4
426,good app. accurate swims.,4
427,why is my Surname (that I've had for 50 years) not accepted on my profile? i find this offencive! Unlike my surname which is NOT offencive! It means taking the Helm or Protective!!,5
428,With Galaxy Watch.. Love it!,5
429,Battery runs low fast Application crashes frequently.,2
430,Absolutely inaccurate. 300m counted of 500m.,1
431,Crashes every time.,1
432,One of the best fitness apps I have used!,5
433,I have a couple of comments but generally it's better than inbuilt Samsung app.,4
434,Love the automatic syncing from my Garmin watch,5
435,Very helpful for virtual coaching,5
436,tried and tried to record a swim... wouldnt let me.,1
437,Doesn't work with Fitbit sense... Sad,1
438,Why cant i screenshot my swim any more due to a privacy policy Spoiled it for me,1
439,Why is my Fossil Gen 4 smartwatch not campatible for this app?,1
440,doesn't work with pebble and uses rediculous retarded measuring system,1
441,Very compreensive statistics,5
442,Can't even open app,1
443,Can't live without this app!,4
444,"great app, very accurate",5
445,Google fit integration is broken,1
446,Send notices to them..never reply...wont work as they say...don't bother,1
447,Great app for swimmers!,5
448,Best swim tracking app,5
449,Needs a little tweaking.,5
450,Will not send my swim history back from galaxy watch,1
451,Not compatible with Vapor 2.,1
452,Very good package,4
453,Rubbish when used with samsung watch 4,1
454,A great app!,5
455,Much better than speedon,4
456,Doesn't work on fossil wear,1
457,I am glad with this App,5
458,Great swimming app,5
459,New things for me. Honest distance.,5

466,Great App!,5
467,🙂🙂👌👌,4
468,Great!!,5
469,not working,1
470,I used to love this app now it freezes at the end of my workout and then all my workout info disappears,2
471,Cool,5
472,Great app,5
473,Prompt feedback,5
474,Nice app,5
475,Great app,5
476,Good,5
477,Great,5
478,"Given Android Wear compatibility with Fossil Sport is advertised, I'm disappointed with the current version. It doesn't know where I'm swimming despite GPS and a database of pools. The watch is incredibly inaccurate at tracking my swim, tonight's 2km was only recorded as 1.5km. I'm hoping these are just small software problems that can be rectified soon, it has so much promise! App lacks material design and any link to Google Fit that provides any accurate/meaningful data to my workout journal.",1
479,Very good,5
480,Excellent,5
481,great,4
482,Love it!!,5
483,good,4
484,great app,5
485,"Just started using it again after two years, looks like some nice updates have been done.",4
486,excellent app with my smart watch,5
487,This app has improved greatly over the years. It could still be better at the social side.,4
488,Awesome app that keeps me motivated. Connected to my Pebble. Hopefully they keep up their support of the Pebble. Update 1/10/19: sadly support for Pebble has ended. Hopefully the developers can add it back because it was working non-stop for me. I don't understand why they would remove a working feature. I even uploaded my last workout on 1/8/19. It's such a shame! This truly is a great app and maybe the developers will take pity on me and other Pebblers and support Pebble again.,5
489,Could better support Pebble watch at least save the watch type settings... 2019 despite the fact that that the application does not support them as much anymore I have been surprised to see my latest uploaded automatically this morning so I give it back out five star,5
490,Does not work with Samsung Galaxy Watch. Will not pair. Have a fully waterproof watch that I want to swim with. Used to think that app was great. Please update asap. Thanks,3
491,The app is working as intended now on Sony Smartwatch 3. Thanks for the fix,5
492,"This is the best app at mostly accurately counting my laps. Terrible at 
breaking up intervals. Example: Even though I flip at each turn it will 
show I swam 4x25 instead of 200. Does not distinguish between strokes. I 
like that i can force it to count drills so kick sets aren't lost. Overall, 
I have to spend a lot of time editing my workouts after it uploads. It also 
takes a long time before it uploads on my phone. Sometimes half a day. I 
use this with Gear Sport.",3
493,No longer installs into Sony smartwatch 3.,1
494,Latest version crashes on SmartWatch 3,1
495,Ok,4
496,"Tried this app with three Casio WSD-F20 smart watch. Useless, the developer 
promised it would work after updates but it's probably worse. All I want is 
an app that can accurately track my lengths, this one doesn't do that.",2
497,"Works ok with the pebble time. Doesn't recognise breast-stroke or drills. 
Otherwise works great",4
498,"With Samsung Gear Sport. This is the best of the swimming apps I've tried 
in terms of accuracy.",4
499,Works great with Sony smart watch 3,5
500,"Works well now. Sometimes inaccurate, seems you need to avoid moving your 
watch hand when approaching pool edge",4
501,Awesome well designed app. Does it sync with new Samsung Gear?,4
502,"Great idea. Needs sync with Samsung Health and Map My Run. So far it gets the distance correct most of the time, unlike Speedo On or S Health, but it does not always detect my strokes correctly (Samsung Gear Sport). I get freestyle or unknown. At least I can edit this on the website and in the app (took me a while to find out how). Also the app is very slow to load each section. Looking forward to updates.",3
503,"I was really excited to start using this off-season. I opened the app and creates my account, but it won't let my last name contain the word ""ecchi"" in it. My last name is Carnesecchi. I'm not going to change my last name, this is very aggravating",1
504,This app is great,5
505,This app seems to not work with the new the misfit vapor or fossil q sport control. It requires you to press the only physical button and the watches already have prebuilt functions for it that make it impossible to use,1
506,At last it works for me v2.0.1  good job,5
507,"The latest version has a completely new interface, but no added functionality pre-swim - it is in fact less intuitive to use. I can't figure out how to change the pool anymore, unless this feature has been removed altogether?  More data & analysis are now available after a swim, and although it may take getting used to the new interface, I think that's a nice addition. Using Sony Smartwatch 3.",3
508,The New version sucks.  Bring back the old one.  Editing is too hard.  Rest periods are now counted as a lap.  The visual appeal is completely gone.   I would give the old version 5 stars.  Really a giant step backwards.,1
509,New version sucks battery now.,3
510,"Overall it is a good application considering it is free, it still has few problems. I am using a Nixon Mission with android wear 2.0, my hardware button works for theater mode but the app does not start if the display setting is not at always on. I can not change the yards to meters on the watch but can fix this with phone app. Still it is anoying. I tried it in 4 different day none count the whole labs the best was 10% off, it counts the srokes etc. but miss a turn and adds all the remaining turns as a single lap. Finaly ftom a computer I managed to add my watch to phone app but now I have nixon and android watch saperetly and only the android watch works if I try the nixon icon it opens a web describing how to transfer data from a germin watch. Hope some of these can be fixed in upcoming updates. I especially need an accurate lap count and meter option selectable on the watch.",4
511,"Used this on a Pebble Steel for about 2 years with weird synchronisation problems. EDIT 23/8 - Am now using a Nixon Mission on Android Wear 2.0. Surprisingly I can still put the watch into theater mode despite what official support site says - with two presses of the button. I've done three swims so far. Sad to say, the tracking's been a total mess. Using the app to merge intervals and laps, I've managed to fix one workout, but was forced to delete two workouts which were unfixable (where I swam the speed of an Olympic champion, or across the lap in 3 strokes).  EDIT 15/9 - Discovered that the previous problems was due to swimming with hand paddles. If I swim without hand paddles, the tracking seems to detect the laps and strokes pretty accurately (tested across 3 swim sessions), and only gets the intervals wrong which is fixable in the app later. So now I am forced to swim without hand paddles in order to get my tracking data correctly.",3
512,"The app was working mostly with my Sony smartwatch 3 until late Jan, now it just won't upload my workout at all.  Not sure what's going on as it was working fine before.  I hope they can fix it soon as it is totally useless now  Update:. I have to uninstall and reinstall to get upload to work and I have to do it every 2 to 3 days.  It is also crashing a lot more during swim so it lost all my current swim data",3
513,"Indeed unusable with Android 2. It does not make sene to wait for an update from Android. There is already a theater mode, although it is not triggered by double tap. Currently, you need to swiping down, but it is impossible to do this when the swim app is open.",1
514,"Works well with my Pebble, and gives me fairly accurate stroke/lap counts and times. Occasionally takes a little while to sync but the in-app explanation is pretty clear!",4
515,"So buggy. Editing a manually entered workout is almost impossible, defaults to a random pool I've never heard of then cannot be changed, and deleting a workout is completely impossible, have to go to desktop to do it",2
516,"The app has always been a bit slow to use, but it looks like the new versions of this and the Pebble app have broken the connection so I can't synchronise my swims from my watch. I fear Pebble will no longer be a supported device though.",3
517,Love this app. Keeps track of what I do. Syncs with Garmin Connect easy,5
518,Incompatible with Android Wear 2.0 because it depends on the removed double-tap to enter theater mode gesture.,1
519,"Asks the length of the pool, but cannot calculate distance by lengths of laps you swam.",1
520,"Not accurate at tracking distance, which makes it pretty useless.",2
521,"What is an *achievement* for, if you don't tell me how fast I was?",3
522,"Unable to login, fail.",1
523,Very good and reliable app,5
524,"Really good app, latest couple of updates have fixed a couple of the bugs and it no longer seems to ""drop"" any sessions. Would be good to have the number of lengths displayed rather than total distance swam (my pool is 43 yrds so going of distance swam is hard). Works well with my SM3 and Huawei p9. Would be great if it could remember my default pool again, it remembers the default length but not the venue. Thanks for the continued development, its saved me buying a garmin for pool training!",5
525,Works again with smartwatch after update. Nice app. The home pool should be default. Everytime I have to set my home pool from yards to meters.,4
526,Kind of works for me. Pebble is a bit inaccurate as a lap counter etc.,4
527,"Support fixed my pixel xl and Nixon issue, thanks. Round watchfaces next?",3
528,"Good app. Suggestion, add All swim personal best",4
529,Intriguing app. All you need to do is swim and everything comes alive,5
530,"I used this on my Oneplus 3 with Sony Smartwatch 3. This app keeps crashing consistently on my phone, whenever I open ""Deivces"" submenu to upload my swimming data from Sony Smartwatch 3. I have also noticed crashes on my watch some times while swimming. I created a support ticket. Initially it was dealt by some support guy, later no response from them.  Good app, only if it works :(",2
531,"Overall I like it. There are some missing features like integration with Google fit. It also stop working during workout, but as I said overall it does job good. Just continue to work on the app. There are still a lot to be done.",4
532,Functional but does not play nice with my pebble. I lose workouts in the ether and it's annoying.,4
533,At first I had difficulty to correct my location and change from yard to meter. Figured out can do it thru web. Suggestion: integration with Google Fit; add the session start and end time to the logs.  Update: very inaccurate lap counting with my smart watch 2. That makes it useless.,2
534,"Lately beginning to see bugs here folks. On Sony Smart Watch 3, 1. Time will start but no meters clocking up. 2. Look again meters have added on after 300m. 3. All good back to normal, then boom, all current data lost, and default back to zero on the watch whilst swimming.4 Sync data hoping my previous 800m swim is there, no sync, data lost. 5. Did test on water for 5 secs,when syncing shows all, zeros on app. Any on else same dramas? Software issue? Watch issue?",3
535,"The app is greatly designed on the phone but once on my android wear watch (Nixon Mission) the design doesn't work it isn't optimised for circular displays, won't sync with my phone and can't change from yards to meters. I really need a swim tracking app the foundation is there PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE try to fix this asap",1
536,"The accompanying app on my Pebble Time tracks workouts pretty well, but too often, they just disappear when I attempt to sync (25-50% of the time).  I need to memorize the details after every swim just in case.  Very annoying.",4
537,"Doesn't work with Sony SmartWatch 3. The watch and the app connects fine, but then... Nothing. It registers a couple of meters, then just idles. The SmartWatch app is so fiddley and non-intuitive to use that it's best to keep away from it. Too bad it's a free app, otherwise I would definitely demand a refund!",1
538,"Cannot select meters when starting a workout on my SWR50. Also, for some reason, lap detection didn't work - is there a specific setting that might block this (e.g. wrist gestures and location turned off)?",3
539,Use this loads on my Pebble classic and it's great but recently bought the latest polar M600 android wear watch and it won't connect to the watch.  Such a shame,2
540,"Very useful to keep track of swim sessions and follow process. The smartwatch app however is sort of complicated,  needs getting used especially when selecting the pool,  pool length and restarting with the brakes while swimming",4
541,Lacks Google Fit sync * Only syncs to watch when I tap watch picture * Ignores Material Design guidelines * Doesn't show calories * Support ignore all emails,2
542,I have a sony smart watch and I have tried 3 times in the pool to get it to track my swim but nothing????? Really frustrating as one of reasons bought watch 😠,1
543,Keeps tracks when I swim laps so I dont have to.  Syncs with my pebble watch. I know exactly how far Ive gone.,5
544,Most of the screen is cut off on my Nixon Mission (one of the few waterproof Android wear watches),2
545,no work out upload by pebble2,3
546,I absolutely love this app!,5
547,Works great with garmin 920 xt,5
548,😭,2
549,Great program,5
550,Ok app,5
551,Use this with a Pebble Time. Stats are completely off. One lap I can do in 12 seconds and then the next in 43. Sometimes it captures my swims; sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it just stops tracking. Support was useless the first time I contacted them so why do I even bother. I feel I am just a beta tester who never gets an app update that really works.,1
552,"Does not automatically sync and no way to delete swims. So if you accidentally start the phone app, there is a 0m swim in your time line.",2
553,"I have lost a few swims...no indication that it was successful our crashed or intentionally deleted :)   I use a SW3, and it is VERY difficult to navigate after the swim...due to it being wet (duh), so a simpler and safe exit would be great, preferably using the physical button rather than relying on the touch screen, at least for the most common case.",2
554,Tried the app out with my sw3. Seems to work on but cant change the to pool length to yards.,4
555,Great app to track my lap swimming. It even syncs with devices like Garmin or Pebble,5
556,Not so good for p.time,3
557,"Awkward to use. Sometimes works and uploads but often crashes losing results on the device. Frequently fails to recognise a lap in the pool, especially in the first few laps. Suggest a calibration feature.",1
558,"I downloaded the app. It setup straight away on my pebble. I chose, ""sign up with Google"" And Huston we have a problem! First it asks me to now sign in manually. Then it tells me that's not my password. Umm ¡¡YES IT IS!! Then in ""reset password"" it tells me ""there's no account with that email"" then in new setup it tells me I ""can't use that address as an account already exists with that (#fffffing!!) email address"" :-[ And 'yards'!!! What is this the 1700s",1
559,This app works well with my Garmin bioactive and Garmin connect.   I wish it was a bit more like strava with challenges,4
560,It's a great app to record your swimming distance. Very easy to use. Great to look at the weekly patterns,5
561,Stops tracking mid swim on the pebble time. This issue needs to be fixed.,1
562,When it syncs with my pebble it's fantastic.......It doesn't always sync😐,3
563,"Buggy, won't sync with pebble and Nexus 5x",1
564,I can't believe how excited I get when this app actually records the workout properly! I have never experienced such a buggy program. Too bad really,1
565,As new features added.. I can manually add my swim workout.. Love it.. No thanks to my sony smartwatch 3..failed after 6 months.. Sony water resist is such a failure.. Don waste ur money on Sony products 👎,5
566,"I love how well this app integrates with my Pebble classic.  Once in a while it will miss a 25, but 99% of the time it works great.",5
567,A must for pool swimmers. No open water features but still great.,5
568,Everything is working again.,5
569,"Using on Sony Smartwatch3 works OK but no way to exit App after workout, have to 'quit' the app and loose the data. Its glitchy with setting default pool length, seems to defaults to  yards instead of meters. I loaded my 'home' pool club details via the web and app but a week alter they are not showing as selectable. Contacted support a week ago and nothing heard - now returning the watch,  this App is useless without support.",2
570,I used this with my pebble Time .  I swam two sets today.  First set was 500m. It showed 400m. I swam 100 more and it only registered 25. Then I reset watch and swam 100 more and it showed I swam 25 again.  Ridiculous. I'll stick with my old swimovate poolmate.  I'd be interested if they updated and it actually worked because I like the app's breakdown of swim and many other functions. Very disappointing.,1
571,Just needs some bugs fixing... Unreliable to start workout... End up wasig a load of time trying to get it to start and again at the end of the work out... Pause/stop not working so have to quit out of the app and then lose all record of the workout....,3
572,Uploading has not been possible in the last week. No responses from pebble as to the problem. Support is not always as strong as one might want. Emailing Pebble  seems to be next to useless. When it works it's fine when it doesn't it's frustrating,2
573,"Since two last updates, pebble disconnects when I start the app in my phone. In the pool, it stars measuring distance then stops. Just buggy!",1
574,"Awesome app, have been using for about 3/4 weeks with my Sony Smartwatch. Other than a couple of swims where the app crashed it's tracked all my swims pretty much floorlessly.  Occasionally picks wrong stroke, but that's like 1 in a 100+ lengths, and could be down to me!!",5
575,"great app, have been using with Sony Smartwatch 3. Would be great if you could use heart rate with it? Also, would be good to sync with trainingpeaks?",4
576,Worked for a while but now doesn't log anything. Seems to just reset or switch off after being put into theatre mode -  on Sony Smartwatch 3.,2
577,In the past I was having connection problems that rendered the app almost useless. At the moment my pebble time steel is working great. Auto rest detection is also a welcome addition and saves me from touching the pebble underwater (more healthy for watch electronics),5
578,I have now got the app to work on Sony Smartwatch 3 (have to set screen to always on) Sync now working by forcing to do manually. No response from developer to questions although now not required as worked it out my self!,4
579,"Very dissatisfied out of the last five swims three have been lost or uploaded with errors and two have the incorrect length for example a swim of one hour comprised of 1300 meters the app saved it as 25 meters as it switched it self off not saving the  data, on several occasions it doesn't even log a length, very disappointing :-(",1
580,This app takes a LONG time to load and it feels it was developed in 2007. It really sucks. Not unstalling it because it doesn't have any competitor.,1
581,"I'm finding I'm much more motivated to swim, for about 6 months now. Excited to be closing on on my 100k mark since starting tracking.",4
582,Works better with Pebble time steel.  Still needs improvements in syncing workouts.,4
583,Timed out after my 11th lap. What's the point of having the app if I have to stop every lap to press the button.,1
584,"Sync is terrible, not sure it's accurate either.  Great idea, but this app is poorly supported.",2
585,"Improved app, improved watch app, connectivity issues seem to be resolved with the Pebble.",5
586,Stopped working as it used to,1
587,Use this app at least 3 times per week with my Sony Smartwatch. I have noticed a small bug with the latest version were its reporting the date as being a incorrect format.  I'm sure it will get fixed with a update.. :),5
588,Another update. Same old upload issues. Should learn not to get my hopes up for this app.,1
589,It's so easy to use.   Sure a few improvements could be made to the interface and viewing but for a free app its outstanding.,5
590,"App is basic, could do with the manual mode that the website has. It's not much use if all I can do is look at what I've done.",3
591,App turns Bluetooth off and on every single time it is started.. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? What if I listen to music via Bluetooth headphones and DON'T WANT TO TURN BLUETOOTH OFF???,1
592,It's unreliable,1
593,"Pretty good app and the only one I have found which works with a Sony Smartwatch 3 - the best smartwatch for athletics.   Slightly over-estimates the number of lengths you do, and some of the interactions take a bit of getting used to - took me about 3 goes to select my pool and set its length, and another 3 to work out how to stop the workout.    BUT - once you have learned how to use it, it does track your swimming pretty well, and looking at the reviews, it is in regular development so you can expect it to get better. Couple of feature requests:   Edit your swim to reduce the number of lengths you have swum (regularly adds 5-10%) Integration with Strava and Google fit  Thanks for the hard work all!",4
594,"Firstly let me say that I really appreciate you developing this app.  However, V2 has some big issues.  1. The auto start/stop thing doesn't work. When turning after a length and pushing off, if you glide particularly straight and for too long the pebble thinks that you've stopped and shows that you are resting. This feature just does not work. Which is a shame.  2.You can't cycle between total time and current time for the current set.  3. What do the buttons do now? Complete mystery. Please roll it back.",1
595,Version 2 doesnt work at all. Please roll back. I started counting laps again and using a timer instead.... UPDATE: version 2.1 works like a charm. The manual procedure is the same of what we have before. Thanks for the prompt response.,4
596,"an awful mess. On my Pebble Time it just crashes. It was always inconsistent in counting the lengths, my backstroke messed up the count all the time, but now it won't even start anymore",1
597,Sony Smart watch 3 doesn't accurately track lengths.  Keeping for now in hope fixed as would pay for working version.,2
598,It sets sync date as workout date.,1
599,"Had it crash twice in my last 2 swims where I lost my workout, using the Sony smartwatch 3. On that note, when trying to stop the workout it requires to exact of a movement sidewards to stop your workout and to many movements. Which means the time is not accurate, often takes 2 minutes before I get to stop the workout. Can we please just have one swipe upwards/downwards?  Update: Was done with the workout, tried to stop the workout, couldn't get it to swipe to the right. Then it crashed, workout lost....",2
600,"The app on Pebble app took some figuring out but at least I saw it working and its potential. Afterwards though I could not sign in to the Android app nor the website. The website doesn't even come up for me, just a blank white screen. Couldn't sign up through Facebook either. The Android app kept telling me to check my data connection (which was fine.) I'd like to be able to upload my workouts but so far not so good. I submitted a ticket so we'll see how it goes.",3
601,"Edit: lost another workout. 1 star. The website's great.  The app is ok, but lacks the drill-down information available on the site. You're better off browsing the mobile version, and only using the app to upload data from a swim tracker, like a pebble.  Having said that, integration with a pebble is incredibly unreliable, with workouts regularly requiring multiple attempts to sync, or simply getting lost altogether.",1
602,"Based on 5 mths use, Using pebble & nexus6 Works adequately as a timer as long as you do length change intervals yourself (I found auto detection of end changes really unreliable), but even then most sessions it  sees at least one 50m length as 100m. Not great for accurately timing sessions.  The real problem is the synch with phone app. Workouts so often don't upload and that is a hugely frustrating and app-undermining problem that the team seem to have significant issues resolving over multiple releases.",2
603,"It's okay. Only thing keeping this at 3 stars is that it actually did track my laps. Apart from that, Can't change from yards to meters on a SmartWatch 3. Android watch interface is slow. Phone interface is super slow. Phone app doesn't provide much detail. Good MVP ,I would use again. please work to improve the UI significantly.",3
604,"I only got this to use with my pebble for logging swim times. Have tried it several times and not once has it managed to sync my swim and now the workouts seem to be lost. The pebble app itself is really good, but without being able to save it only half works. Pretty lame really.",1
605,I have tried and tried but it always tells me it has no new workouts.  Even when the watch has it right on screen.  Also: cut the constant complaint about missing data connections.,2
606,"Other than that, this app didn't do much of anything. Just swam a thousand with this on my pebble. It counted one lap. Not much point, then.",1
607,"I've just been for my first swim using my Sony Smartwatch 3, and nothing is syncing! It also showed on the watch that I'd done 500m when I'd only done 450.",1
608,Tried this with Sony sw3 seemed to work ok in the pool but phone app says no workouts,2
609,"Android wear - using Sony Smartwatch 3 ( I think the only one suitable for swimming) been 3 times, uploads fine but recording is massively out. Just swam 48 lengths of a 33.3m pool in 42 mins, breaststroke, with no breaks or pauses. App thinks I swam for 5 mins and rested for 37mins also only recorded 462m instead of 1584m. Gutted as a bought the watch to use this app, currently it's a complete waste of time. Hope it gets a solid update to make it more accurate.",1
610,"Nothing has changed despite numerous updates and reports that ""sync has finally been fixed"". V1.5 on Pebble shows exactly the same behaviour. New workouts do not sync.",1
611,"Galaxy's S5 and Pebble time. Worked for a while. Now (with updates) useless. Always get error message to ""check phone data connection"". Huh?",1
612,"Was working fine with pebble, but recently can't upload any swims. The pebble app itself works fine in the pool though.",2
613,"It says I need to check my phones data connection, but I have a perfectly usable WiFi signal.",1
614,Please check data connection but in on wifi and mobile data.,2
615,"Keeps showing a pop-up that says ""please check your phone's data connection"" even though I'm connected to WiFi! Wanted to use with my Pebble but that's obviously not going to work until this gets fixed. Please help!",1
616,"Was signing up but it is stuck at Step 5. Keeps loading and loading and loading, and now is still loading. After that, I kill the app and login again. I have to login again every time I launch the app. Uninstall.",1
617,Update 1.9 enabled Pebble Time to work,5
618,The whole reason I bought the pebble time was to record swimming work outs... Needless to say the app doesn't work with the time and is a complete hassle and waste to try and get it to connect.,1
619,After a long and annoying setup process the app failed to record my workout,1
620,Can't even say what it is like because despite advertising pebble time support it can't connect to it as it doesn't even recognise that the pebble time uses a different pebble app on your phone from a normal pebble. A really obvious error that bodes poorly for the quality of the software as a whole.,1
621,"Work with Pebble. Says it does, but the workouts don't upload.",1
622,Keeps saying to check data connection even on wifi. Couldnt connect to pebble time.,1
623,"Look like a great app, unfortunately it doesn't recognize my Pebble Time.",1
624,As title,1
625,"Trying to upload any workouts from a pebble has never worked and seemingly never will. I have come to the conclusion that the release of this app was nothing more than an elaborate joke, don't waste your time with it.",1
626,The app is a good idea. Unfortunately it frustrates me that when I swim it tracks my distance up to 550m and then thats it. It will not track further than that when I'm swimming 1600m. There has not been a time where it completely tracked my whole swim. Everytime I see an update I try the app again and I get disappointed. Thats the reason I bought the watch and got the app. I'm hoping it will get fix VER SOON!,2
627,"I understand that the uploads are the fault of Pebble and not this app, but the issue of not being able to sign in while my phone is connected to WiFi is a problem with this app. To successfully sign in, I need to be connected to a mobile network.",3
628,Forces you to create a new account but at Step 1 the app will not show any of the public pools near our location - totally useless. Guessing the only reason it has been added to the Play Store is so they can sell email addresses to SPAM services,1
629,Does not sync with pebble.  Does not track swimming.  Pebble app stops keeping track after 500y worthless.,1
630,Will not allow me to log in. Pretty worthless.,1
631,Edit : Pebble sync still doesn't work after app update. Tried on multiple devices. Failed every single time.              The sync just doesn't work. Proper testing isn't done before releasing the app. Disappointed me. Was the primary reason to buying the pebble watch.,2
632,"I had lots of problems with the standalone Pebble uploader, but the new integrated uploader has worked first time for me for my two workouts since switching from the standalone uploader.",5
633,"Like the other commenters, I have also experienced issues with uploading. But even once workouts are uploaded, it's not that valuable. There are no workout breakdowns (pace, etc per length/50/100), or at least they are impossible to find. The user interface is challenging to navigate. The social aspect has possibilities but it suffers currently from lack of user base. I will keep using the app but it will take some new features before it's something I love.",2
634,"it worked consistently.  I bought the Pebble and got this app for swimming.  Unfortunately, the data transfer from the Pebble to the app (this one and the uploader app) fails to work more than it does work.  Feedback in the pool is limited, but would be acceptable if I could actually get the workouts uploaded after to review the rest of the information.  If you guys don't get this working consistently quickly you will lose all credibility and it will allow someone to come in with something that does work.",2
635,"The app will work, it would track my swim on every lap and then the next time I go to swim, it will stop tracking. It will go as far as 125 meters then stop when I'm at my 400 meter mark. It's very aggravating and I'm at the point of getting rid of my peeble and this app.",1
636,"Polar m600 is an Android watch. However, this app does not work with Polar. Too bad!  I like the idea of a locked screen and hope this can be fixed in the future.",1
637,On my pebble steel I get a message to check my data connection. There's nothing wrong with my data connection. Firmware 2.9.1,1
638,Works great,5
639,Nice,5
640,Useful,5
641,Best,5
642,Code brown,1
643,I like it,5
