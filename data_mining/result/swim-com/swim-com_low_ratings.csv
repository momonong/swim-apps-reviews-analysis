1,"Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple‚Äôs UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the ‚ÄúX‚Äù should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn‚Äôt listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I‚Äôm surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn‚Äôt go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it‚Äôs actually fly).

Lastly, this has a very social media feel to it in some places, especially as I was going through the privacy settings, so if that isn‚Äôt your thing (like it isn‚Äôt for me), make sure you turn your profile to private.",3,"It has potential, but still needs work."
4,"This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you‚Äôre a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I‚Äôm part of a club team and we have ‚Äúwall tap counters‚Äù (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you‚Äôre on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn‚Äôt take into account that some swimmers have longer ‚Äústrides, glides, wingspan‚Äù then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",2,Inaccurate/buggy
6,"I want to like this app. It has potential, and I‚Äôve stuck with it for the past three years. Unfortunately, the bugs are overwhelming. Even something as simple as drill mode, where the app doesn‚Äôt need to do anything except what it is told by the user, fails to record proper distance and time. Not to mention the latest ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn‚Äôt work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What‚Äôs more, half of the time the workouts don‚Äôt upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features. Make the app solid and reliable first, then focus on upgrades.",2,Bug fixes > Useless features
9,"The new iPhone app format update is the worst user interface I've ever seen. Lots of wasted space with useless bar graphs and useless lifetime totals, difficult to see your last workout data, and hard to read it when you find it. And a new focus on offering workouts but if you don't need them you're going to have to constantly navigate around that. The Apple watch workout app shows the real data a million times better. Hopefully they'll fix it because their Apple watch app is better than the workout one. 

Lastly, still useful from an old review:
There are no weekly totals, no analysis of improvement. If they improve all this stuff it could be useful.",1,Needs work on interface in phone app
11,This app is great when it works. Just after the new iOS update the app has been buggy and lost two of my swims. IÔ∏è like that it handles rest between intervals and sets. IÔ∏è also like to set the drill mode. The Apple Watch workout app tracks in the background and it adds to your rings.  Ending a workout can be a pain since the way the Apple Watch and app are relying on pressure. Did a 4000 yard workout with my masters group and the app locked up and lost the workout. It needs serious fixes and an update. May go back to apples fitness app which is harder to handle IÔ∏è. The water for drill sets.,3,Good app
12,"I haven‚Äôt even gotten around to using this app in the pool because the interface/settings are extremely cumbersome. This app won‚Äôt save your preferences on workout searches; it defaults back to the preferences you input when you set up your account. I made the ‚Äúmistake‚Äù of setting up preferences that turned out to be very restrictive and only showed one workout. If I want to search for a new workout, I have to change my preferences every time I navigate away from the Workouts tab. If I favorite a workout after fiddling with my preferences for the umpteenth time, I have to change my settings yet again when I want to view those workouts.",1,Terrible functionality
18,I‚Äôve used this App for 4 years and over the last year it has been crashing and dropping my swims halfway through my 3500 yard sessions. I regularly have to check and manually add 1300+ yard sets to accurately track my total distance. I submitted a report and they told me it was because I‚Äôm not running the current version (which I am on an Apple Series 6). Unfortunately this is the best tracker I have found so far so I deal with the crashes that have become a regular part of my training.,2,Used to work brilliantly
19,I like the app on the Apple watch 2 but doesn‚Äôt translate well to iPhone. The workouts usually take days to sync and the calories always show 0 even though my watch obviously picks up the movement. It just doesn‚Äôt equate to the same number of calories as the resistance brings when the watch knows that your swimming. Not sure I explained well but it‚Äôs frustrating. The only thing I like about his app is that it differentiates resting vs swimming time. Haven‚Äôt found another swimming app that does that automatically.,2,Sync issues. Doesn‚Äôt show calories.
23,When it automatically syncs it is good but each year have problems with this. I love when it works correctly but not so much when it doesn‚Äôt. The service with issues of connectivity or syncing not much help. But it would be five stars if it worked correctly all the time.,3,A sometimes frustrating
26,"I have used this app with my Series 2 Watch, and it worked well. The user interface is great, and accounting for kick drills is excellent. 

It needs an update however for the new Watch iOS. I don‚Äôt blame the developer, but it needs to be addressed. Blows away Apple‚Äôs swim
tracker, when it works.

UPDATE:

I have uninstalled and then reinstalled. Still doesn‚Äôt work on Apple Watch Series 3. Developer is VERY responsive, which is appreciated, but still not working. Hopefully soon because it is an excellent app, when it works.

FINAL UPDATE:

I have done everything short of sacrificing a goat to get this app to work. I even reset my Apple Watch Series 3 to factory settings. After 200 meters, watch read 50. 

Done with this app forever. Great concept, but reality is much different. It just doesn‚Äôt work.",1,Doesn‚Äôt work with Apple Watch 3
27,"I was really excited about this app, but it blocks out all relevant information and covers the face of my watch with just the time of day so it‚Äôs nearly impossible to figure out what my splits are or what comes next in the workout. I tried raising my arm, touching the screen, jiggling the Digital Crown, but nothing reliably called up the info I wanted to see. I finally gave up and went back to the watch‚Äôs built in lap tracker. Disappointing.",1,Makes Apple Watch useless
29,"Frequently adds laps, even for a 100 it may record 125. It also doesn‚Äôt correctly I‚Äôd strokes. Tech support doesn‚Äôt seem interested. I have the latest pre beta version with open water tracking, they told me all bugs were fixed. I use the latest ‚Äúpre‚Äù beta version which I was told had the latest algorithms   Unfortunately I see the same errors as the previous versions",2,Not consistant
33,I like the app and the ability to have my workouts on my Apple Watch.  The connection between the Watch and app does not work and when it does then the app to the activity tracker does not work.  I have followed all the suggestions in the support but it‚Äôs still unstable.  Connection to the internet is not the problem.,3,Good and Bad
35,The concept of the app is great and really needed as there is little support for swimmers.  I have had the app for a long time.  When it was launched I expected it would quickly start aligning with all the watches that support swimming metrics.  I support Polar who have been in the swimming space for a long time.  There is still no support for Polar or a raft of other watches.  If you want to grow your customer base surely appealing to a wider audience is a no brainer but I must be wrong!,1,What‚Äôs the point
36,"I bought my Apple Watch 6 last week. It only tracked 20 of 60 minutes in the pool. I‚Äôm starting out doing kickboard front/back crawls (no arms yet) and the tracking is wonky.

I just want to track my laps. I‚Äôm looking for the swim lap tracker for dummies. I don‚Äôt think this is it yet. I‚Äôll try for another week but I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôm looking still.",2,Noob can‚Äôt track laps
37,Great concept but the ease of use isn‚Äôt there. The app isn‚Äôt intuitive to use and is a bit behind the power curve when it comes to inputting your times. There is no option for tenths and it refers to your time as ‚Äúduration.‚Äù I‚Äôm not thrilled with this at all. Did they use actual swimmers when running this thru testing? I can‚Äôt imagine they did.,2,Not thrilled
38,"Some swim sessions are not being saved. Disappeared completely out of the box üòÇ
It gets me frustrated, especially after swimming 4kms ü§Ø
The new update of the app on the apple watch displays a weird layout sometimes, buttons and labels are getting outside of the screen üò≥",3,A bit disappointed
39,"I am able to adjust date of swim, but it does not save. I forget to input day of swim occasionally so unfortunately my swim is posted day late. Hope the ability to do that is fixed. Also, many times I need to input info twice for it to save.",3,Needs improvement
42,Apple Watch SE owner since October 2022. For some reason the app is overstating my distance in the water today I did 500 yards the watch record of 1200 yards however using the native activity app that comes with the phone My distance was recorded accurately. Any ideas?,3,Overstating Distance
44,"To use this app for *anything* you have to turn over incredible amounts of personal information.  If you make any part of your profile ‚Äúprivate‚Äù the app won‚Äôt work with any of the myriad of virtual events. The UI is an abomination and doesn‚Äôt work effectively with manual entries, making this YET ANOTHER ‚Äúservice‚Äù that requires a $300 watch. Very unfortunate that USMS has partnered with such a low quality venture.",1,Utter Garbage
46,"When I complete a warm up the app will then say the workout is complete.  I have to continue the swim to continue to track the workout.  Overall, the app works well besides that glitch.",3,Error
47,"I recently got back into the pool November 2020 and was very pleased that this app would log all of my swim workouts automatically but since Jan 3rd, 2021 it doesn‚Äôt recognize them. I‚Äôm not sure what to do to fix this problem. Please help!!!",3,Unable to log my swim workouts
48,"I was swimming with Garmin watches for a long time, and switch to Apple watch. I'm a technical person work the latest and greatest gadgets, and could not figure out how to connect your app to the watch (it did install it inn the watch).

Lots of interesting ideas, next to no follow through on execution.",1,"Supporting website DNW, only freestyle drills."
56,"I have use this app for a number of years. Early on I found it was fairly accurate, occasionally missing half a lap or so. I‚Äôm not sure what changed but right now the app is completely useless to me because it misses three or four laps at a time on a long segment. I‚Äôve moved on to other apps that work better",1,Drops too many laps
57,"I find this app hard to figure out. Hard to turn off on my Apple Watch. 
Need some instructions as to what steps to do on the phone and watch to have it work the way it‚Äôs designed to. Not happy with it !",3,No so good
58,"This app has been unstable for years. Every time they make a change they break something else. 

The latest is that you can no longer count laps. Pretty basic thing to request. The developers obviously have no quality control. 

The app is also not private. And they share my location and name with others. I have no desire to have my name on a feed when my privacy is important to me. 

At the very least fix the app so it can count laps again instead of yards",1,Latest release can‚Äôt count laps
59,The moment you swim the info on the watch is blurred out and only the time is shown. This is the main thing that makes the app useless and keeps it from being awesome. I don‚Äôt understand why the developer hasn‚Äôt fixed this yet,1,Could be great

112,blah,1,Blah
113,"I have Apple‚Äôs new Series 2 watch. 

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate. (not really necessary but since the data is there it'd be good to incorporate). Hopefully the app will be improved, I like the concept.",2,Needs much improvement
116,"This app seems to have promise, but for this swimmer of quite modest abilities, it is not yet ready to replace my Garmin swim watch.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin. These should be basic features of any swim  watch software.

I will watch for software updates before trying again.",3,E for effort
119,"The app is slow and clunky with an unintuitive interface. Instead of focusing on giving us quick and easy access to our swimming metrics, this app seems to instead focus more on social stuff and finding swimming pools (which it isn't very good at) and it has the word ""unknown"" misspelled as well. Building a custom workout is actually way harder and slower than it should be, plus you constantly have to wait for the app to contact the servers because no one on the development team thought people might want to store their data locally on their phone. 

It's not terrible but it certainly isn't good.",2,Slow and clunky
124,"Drill feature is great, so I use this over the built in app. However anything I do fast over a 50 is counted wrong. Did last 4 times I've done a 100 fast I'll go in the 55-56 range it gives me a time of 1 minutes and says I only did a 75.  Same thing for the 200, only days I've done a 175.  Times are also off. It thinks I'm resting almost 5 seconds after I have actually finished.  Overall not terrible, drill mode is the only thing that keeps me using it since I can add back in those laps it missed.",2,Fast swimming count and times off
125,"Apple's built-in activity app is very accurate for tracking distance and deducing stroke type, but it requires manually stopping its chronometer to check time on individual sets, save or discard the record and launch a new activity before a new set. Very tedious! 

This app has been very good at stopping the clock when I come to a rest and smart enough to reset the clock to zero before I start swimming again. Big thumps up! Unfortunately, its distance and stroke count is horribly inaccurate. At the moment, I can only use it as a smart chronometer.

It also nags about gaining access to health data numerous times a day. Very annoying. Ask once and stop bothering me for at least a week. 

Hoping for the bugs to be fixed or a better alternative app to be launched.",3,Inaccurate distance tracking
129,"I'm happy with the app and website overall, but a few weeks ago the yards I enter in Drill Mode on my Apple Watch don't transfer to the app or website even though they show up on my watch.  It is basically a waste of time to use the drill mode since none of the yards show up.  I contacted customer service about this a few weeks ago and never heard any response.",3,"Really nice app, but drill mode still broken"
132,"I find this app kind of spotty. For instance, it doesn't seem to capture different strokes mid workout. If I'm doing freestyle and switch to breaststroke it skips a lap or two before it picks it up. It also doesn't capture all my workouts although that could be a function of a recent update, that wiped out a couple workouts. In any case, I don't find it that much better than what Apple Watch gives you.",3,Just ok
136,"I have never felt so disappointed about an app as this one. It glitches out and doesn't record anything every third to every other time I swim. I originally got this app for the stroke count and because it could differentiate between each set. I don't know what the purpose of using it is if it glitches out so often. Rest assured it will be deleted. FYI, this week out of the 5 times I swam, it recorded 3. DISAPPOINTING",1,Extremely disappointed. Glitches out DURING swim practice every third time
137,"Pebble Time works great to track your distance during the workout. But syncing the Pebble to the app is Russian roulette. Every few work outs it will not only NOT sync the work out but will delete the workout too! Really frustrating when you are trying to track progress and use goals to motivate.

Really disappointed that they couldn't get this fundamental part of the whole app sorted out by now!",2,App sync is spotty at best!
139,"Since getting the new waterproof Apple Watch, I have been searching for a great swim tracking app.  This looked like it might be the one - until I discovered that there is.

151,"The interface and ability to record kick sets held a lot of promise. But, alas, during my first workout the app recorded 175 yards for my 400 yard warmup. It was flummoxed by my 100 IM, recording only 25 yards... I switched mid workout to the native activity/swim app and it accurately counted the rest of my workout. 
I'll be deleting this app. Maybe they will improve in the future. 
Also I am concerned that it does not water lock the watch.",1,Not accurate
156,"Love that I can use my pebble time to track my swims, but syncing is a crapshoot. Probably 30% of the time sync fails and workout data is lost.

Next swim I start tracking, swim 400m and look at watch to see 75m. Using Apple Watch 2.

Interface is very slow and non native, forced to setup an account with a login system that disallows certain characters for email but allows you to create the account, just not login ever again. Password must be short and bad.

I would forgive those bits of tracking actually worked.",2,Use apple activity swim mode instead
165,"This app seems to be early beta status.

1. Like other users, uploading is spotty at best.

2.  App is pretty limited on what you can log about workout.  Easier for me just to go to website on a pc.

3.  I use Pebble time, and accuracy on lap counting is pretty horrible.  I swim 1-2 miles per workout and it does not track well.  Drills and sprints seem to track better,  maybe because motion is more vigorous than my distance swims. 

Ill give it another month and update if they have managed to make something of this.",2,"Im hopeful, but disapointed so far"
170,Unfortunately when you are done and try to upload the workout the app does not synchronize the data from Pebble. It's worth noting the watch app works amazing accurately but it is a shame the data cannot be uploaded to track your swimming activities,2,App does not synchronize
171,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The past three times it wouldn't sync, no matter WHAT I did. I followed instructions, but wouldn't sync the new workouts. I would LOVE to be able to count on this app to work. Hopefully they will fix it soon.",2,Works sometimes

209,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",3,Poor execution
210,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work. 

At this point between your faulty features and terrible customer service I'll wait to deal with one of your competitors that gets custom pool sizes into their app.",1,Faulty features - terrible support

224,It is accurate with yardage and stroke recognition. I like the drill and pace function. My biggest issue is the poor data transfer back to the iPhone app. Sometimes it works and other times it will not transfer back to the phone.

225,"I love this app because the swim.com leaderboard has inspired me to swim an incredible distance, over 4000 km in two years. I have moved up from 271 to number 2 on the worldwide total distance leaderboard. 

I love this app because I can look at workout statistics after each workout that is uploaded to swim.com. 

I hate this app because it randomly refuses to upload  my workouts from my Apple Watch to swim.com app on the phone. Surprisingly, it will upload those workouts to the apple activity app for total distance only. But then I get no credit for the leaderboard on Swim.com. By my I have lost up to 100 km of leaderboard distance credit this way. 

I hate this app because the feature of leaderboard filter over specific time periods eg distance last week, last month, last 2 months, etc. has never worked. 

I hate this app because I have contacted swim.com multiple times about these issues. While the written responses are very friendly, nothing is fixed. 

There is so much promise to this app if it would just be tweaked to work better.",3,Love/Hate
226,"This app worked great for me for about a month. I love the drill function as I do a fair amount of kicking and one armed fly drills. And the planned workout integration is nice for more advanced swimmers. My only suggestion would be to allow more data integration into the activity app so you can see sets there (like you can if you use the Apple Watch Workout app). But just a suggestion as the Swim.com app does allow this. 

Then the swim.col app stopped syncing with the health app. My privacy settings are set to allow the swim.com app to write and read the motion and fitness data. My sources are all setup in the health app. Nothing syncs. Started suddenly and for no apparent reason (no iOS or app updates happened between when it was working and now). I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling all sorts of apps. Restarting the phone and watch. Hard restarting the phone. Even restoring my iPhone. No dice. The biggest problem for me is that I no longer see a workout logged in activity app. I get the exercise credits because my heart rate was up, but no workout is logged. 

I have contacted the app developers several times. No response. I will have to stop using this app and start using the workout app. And manually logging kicking yards. I‚Äôd really much prefer to not do this, but oh well. Perhaps it‚Äôll start working at some point.

227,I have used this app with my old Apple Watch Series 2 and tried again with the Series 4. It continues to overestimate my laps.

229,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",2,Great Concept. Poor Execution.

231,"It's January now and I haven't been able to sync between my Pebble and this app since August, and I've tried all kinds of gyrations to try and get them to sync. Now it is much WORSE. I just updated the Pebble part of the Swim duo and it has completely taken over my watch. I kill the swim app and it comes back before I can get to any other menu item, so I can't even reboot the watch. And this version still asks to be made my Activity app every.single.time.it.runs no matter that I keep saying no. If it was a person, we would call that a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The ONLY reason I keep using is because the stopwatch digits are big and easy to read while I'm in the pool and not wearing my glasses.",1,Poor experience with Pebble
