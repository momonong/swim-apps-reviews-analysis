0,"After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",4,Improved tracking but data analysis still weak
2,"They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets. 

Still, I do like the improvements they’ve made in the last few years. Keep working on it.",4,"Good, but a little wonky with stroke detection"
3,"At 70 yo I sometimes ( no, all the time) need motivation in these times to get up and do something healthy   Keeping track of my daily yardage and checking cumulative weekly, monthly and annual yards against others in similar age groups keeps me getting up early and driving daily to the Y.  Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.",5,Use it for motivation
5,"Installed this app because I was looking for some better views on my watch of laps, time, heart rate, etc when swimming. The Apple Workout app wasn’t cutting it for me. The watch views are exactly what I was looking for but I noticed after a couple swims that my active calories are significantly under reported compared to the Apple app. When comparing heart rate data from other workouts it seems this app is under reporting rather than other apps over reporting. The difference is significant for a 30 minute workout, about half the reported calories.",4,Good Watch Views; Questionable Activity Tracking
7,I like this app because it’s the only one I know of that lets me edit back in my kick set yardage after the workout is done. There is no choice for a kick set in the editing section so I call them a drill. App worked well until recently then suddenly stopped uploading data to Apple health. After about one month an update was released and now everything is working properly again.,4,Stopped uploading to Apple health
8,"Easy to use and manually add my yardage. I have a iWatch but can't figure out how to use it with this site
When I click the Leaderboard, it only shows I've done 75yds so I'm obviously doing something wrong as my 3x per week swims are close to 7,500.  I'm 67 yrs of age and since covid pandemic have been away from synchronized swimming so loving the pool again 
Not techi but at least I can manually enter my yardage
Reported my pool as having changed names and it was quickly corrected!   Thank you!",5,Enjoy tracking
10,Communicated with John who was very helpful. App has always correctly recorded times for me for the almost two years that I’ve used it. But one swim recently showed correct total time but recorded each length as exactly same time - obvious error. John guided me through a few steps and consulted with his engineer. Problem seems to have fixed itself. I appreciated John’s concern and his checking in with me later to verify app was working fine now.,5,Weird record on one particular swim
13,Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line,4,Strava integration could be better
14,"This app works. I am not sure where all the complaints come from. It counts laps, yards/meters, shows heart rate in one place. The new redesign on AW is just perfect. Especially the color coding. The stats on phone seems to be a little “cluttered” but still show all that is needed. This review comes from a guy with over 40 years of experience swimming. To developers, keep up the great work. Thanks!",5,Great app for swimmers!
15,This has been happening to me in the past month at least one a week and I was hoping the new update would fix this but it happened again today and I lost all my data! I was doing a drill and I was ready to do my last 100 yards and I looked at my watch to check my pace and the app was back to the start as if I had not just swim 2500 yards.,4,Stops working during swim
16,"Only complaint is there’s no option to NOT put in distance. Sometimes I just swim for “time” and don’t count the distance. App requires a multiple to place in the distance box. I just put in a random number and then in the notes I explain what I did on this particular training day. Other than that, app is easy to use and very useful, especially for me as a “returning swimmer”, so I can measure my progress. Cheers!",5,Awesome app!
17,"My primary complaint is that the last lap appears to throw in a couple of seconds. One can check this by comparing the splits against the last. Now to work around this problem, I simply add another 50 yards to the interval and use the next to last split and final times. And it makes a better workout!

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

You are building a very good tool and our requests are a testimony that we’re using it but want more. Very common in the software business.

As I mentioned earlier I would be happy to pay for this app so don’t stop!

And thank you!",4,Still not as good as the original swimsense but it’s a very good tool.
20,"More accurate than iSwimStat, and I compare it with a couple others but this doesn’t load quickly. It takes hours or even days to show up even though I refresh many times. Not sure if I’m using it correctly.  Synched with Apple Watch.",4,Not loading stats
21,I like this app - it’s free and you can’t argue with the value for what it does (other apps charge you for stats/membership). The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is my being unable to put/list myself on leaderboard. Perhaps it’s just a learning curve - I’m using this app only for a 3-4 months. Do you know how I can fix that?,4,Great app
22,"In my opinion, the best app. It stops automatically, you have the possibility to record distance swam for drill mode (apple watch native exercise app does not offer this possibilty), you have the possibility to swim a set in a fixed amount of time (repeat in), which is another important feature that the native app does not have).",5,The best!
24,"Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from regarding accuracy. This app comes within 50 yards of my 3000+ yard workouts, and gathers excellent data. The best part, however, is an easily accessible drill mode for kick sets. Best swim app available at time of this writing, and I’ve tried them all.",5,Very Accurate For Pool Swimming
25,"After 3 years of using this app, I can say it covers all the needs of the swimmer and it keeps evolving and adding functionalities.

Unmatched and highly responsive customer support makes it even better.",5,Excellent App and customer support
28,"Never had an issue with calorie transfer to health app until the recent update that was supposed to fix an issue regarding that. Said I burned 197,000 calories the first swim workout I completed since the new update. I have an Apple Watch 5 and iphone12 plus.",4,Recent update
30,"Have nearly 900k yards tracked with only a handful of errors. Accurate tracking, consistent splits, and one button start/stop. On top of that, developers that listen and want to fix issues and constantly make this app better. Highly recommended.",5,The Best Swim Tracker
31,"I had some issues with the Swim app on my Apple Watch a few years ago so I switched to Apple’s swim workout app -that is until Swim stopped loading the data (I think due to an Apple update)

Now that I’m using Swim again, I notice two problems. 

1) the calories count is about half what it should be on my 2250 yard swim, but agrees with Apple’s count on my 250 yard swim. 

2) I typically do a long swim (2250 yds) followed by a short (250 yd swim). My last 2 sessions (using the Swim app on my Apple Watch 3) only one swim would load on swim. 
One time the app crashed when I ended the longer swim.",4,Calorie count seems off
32,"This app is exactly what I wanted!
-build swim workouts
-track swim workouts

4/5 stars because it’s very slow and communication with my Apple Watch is a bit glitchy. Couldn’t track this morning’s swim. Saw the update and downloaded it just now so hopefully that helps.",4,Perfect but slow
34,"Downloaded the app and tried to create a new account by putting all my info in, but I clicked on create new account nothing worked.",5,Will not let me create a new account
40,"It used to auto-import swim workouts from the health app, but for some reason they removed that feature. Now it’s back.",4,auto-imports swim workouts fixed
41,Great website to use for logging and viewing my swim stats,5,Great app enjoy using and seeing the data breakdown after my swim / very helpful.. thanks
43,The leaderboard feature is absolutely incredible! Couldn’t have asked for a better tracking device!,5,Fantastic!
45,Love building workouts and viewing them on my Apple Watch while swimming. Tracking accuracy is the best compared to other apps.,5,Love this App!
51,Picked up swimming again and it really helps me track my progress!,5,Keeps me on track
60,Joining challenges keeps me going back to swim. Updates are slow but great for tracking swims.,4,Great motivator
65,Manual entry of a swim does not sync with Apple Health.  I have no issues with other health apps linking with Apple Health.,4,Manual entry does not sync
71,Great.,5,Much better than Apple Watch native tracker
73,Love this app. It helps motivate me and keep me on track.,5,Love everything about app
77,This app has really helped me get motivated to get back in the pool!,5,Great motivation!
80,Many rhanks for the great app and all the functionalities around it! Fantastic job particularly under our COVID 19 circunstances4 congratulations!,4,Great app & swim community
87,I love using this app in the pool. I wish they would add an open water swim tracker.,4,Love the App for the pool
95,"I love the app,it has saved me from my home app.",5,BIM
100,"Pretty good app. Syncing with my Garmin device finally after multiple attempts. I like the easy to read format and the ability to add a pool as well as a few other features though if I had my wishes I would request:
- my records section. I want to see my best times for different distances. It is cool to show a badge for fastest 400 yard but what is that time record? I think you can see this on the site but I could not find in app. 
- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths 
- more workouts to do. Options seem pretty limited to shorter distances. Master swim classes will do a 1650 for warm up. 
- drill videos would be cool. I know they are available through you tube but it would be cool if they were here and built into the workouts.",4,Getting there. A few more things and this would be really good.
103,it’s work well even if the pool size is not standard lap.,5,good swimming app
111,"THIS APP IS SO GOOD AND LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE 

DOWNLOAD NOW!!!",5,SUCH A GOOD APP
114,"At first I was disappointed that the app didn't count my breaststroke or kick sets, but the more I use it, I see that it's algorithm is learning my strokes and adapting its analysis. All my breaststroke is now counted accurately and is starting to sometimes give me credit for kick sets. 

Even if it never quite gets the kicks counted, the ability to sense the difference between swimming and resting and the stats (some of which you can access immediately) put this app head and shoulders above the others I've tried on the Apple Watch.",4,Works well with Apple Watch
115,"Still a little buggy. I uninstalled, then reinstalled after the app crashed when I still had 20 laps to complete. It may have been the Apple Watch because the Apple logo appeared and I couldn't bring up any apps. I thought maybe the watch was downloading an IOS update or something. Whatever. It's just very frustrating. I lost all of today's data. Maybe my resistance gloves got in the way and pressed the stem. Other than that, I like this app. Some issues with lap count and stroke recognition though. Not a big deal for a casual swimmer like me.",5,Swim
117,"I have just started using this new app for my swim routines and I can say that this is one of the better swim apps out there so far. I love being able to track my workouts and comparing lap times with my friends and other people who are using this app with ease. Not only that, just from using the app today, I found a few new local pools in my area that I didn't know even existed before! Now that the new Apple Watch is waterproof, this is my go-to swim app to use with it.",5,Best swim app I've used so far!
118,"Bought a new waterproof Apple Watch last week, been shopping for best swim app. My master swim mates recommended this app to me. Absolutely love it!!  Love the fact that this app not only can track my daily swim workout, but also allow me to connect with other swimmers.  The best feature is that I can locate the pool close by using this app. This is huge for me since I need to travel a lot because of work, this make my life much easier as I want to keep swimming every day.",5,Best swim app for Apple Watch so far
120,"I've been using this app with my Apple Watch Series 2 for about three weeks. I have not tried to get super accurate information from it, but it does a very nice job of tracking my yardage and giving me a sense of how I was performing. 

The quick drill setup on the watch is an excellent way to capture those kicking yards that don't get logged by the watch. 

Overall, I am very pleased with the app, and it seems like they keep tweaking it and making it better each time.",4,3 Weeks in and it is good
121,"The watch app is great. It's much more fully featured than apple's swim tracking app. 

However, the iOS software is pretty bad. The swimming stats are poorly organized, and the totals are usually incorrect. For example, any workouts from the current day don't apply to the weekly total.  Also, the charts are wrong (showing workouts which didn't occur). 

Please update the iOS app and fix the bugs!",4,Great watch sw. Poor iOS sw.
122,"Have been using this app with an Appe Watch 2.0 for a few months and have seen steady improvements in what it can do. Appreciate being able to record the skills distances within a workout now. Did have some issues with breast stroke detection, but that seems to be better after current update. Would like to see calories and sharing out from mobile app like you can in web site. Great app!",5,Works Great!
123,I had a Garmin swim before and hated constantly pressing the button to start and stop intervals. That this app automatically distinguishes between intervals and resting at the wall is the single best feature for me. This is also a big improvement over the previous version which required scrolling to see everything and crashed a lot.,5,Love the automatic interval detection!
126,"The Apple Watch app is very reliable for auto-detecting sets (no need to push buttons:-) and strokes. It also has a very easy way to include drill/kicking sets. 

Overall, it's a great app for swimmers!

Suggestion: While HR data from the watch is not always accurate, it would still be useful to have that displayed with the rest of the workout stats.",4,Solid performance!
127,"I really enjoy using this app with my new Apple Watch and the additional details such as split times, swimmers in my area, clubs, etc not available with Apple'a app. The UI needs a little more user flexibility as I had to contact technical support to change my location. Highly recommended, otherwise.",5,"Great App, especially with Apple Watch"
128,"This is a great app for swimming. I like that it captures my drill sets and also returns what I ""just"" swam. I gave it a four star because it's buggy and not working on my Apple Watch. I'm sure it'll get fixed quite soon. Give it a try. I won't be so quick to update, I'll wait on every other one. :)",5,Just updated and app stop working
130,"I use the app frequently and all works well and great!... until... i would say about 1 out 10 swims the screen gets activated and mess up the swim tracking. My last one it wiped out the whole work out. 

So i guess you can turn on the water protection, but then you can glance during swim on progress/time/heartrate... 

Otherwise great app",4,Great swim app... BUT!
131,I didn't want to spend more money on the new AppleWatch to be able to swim. I bought a waterproof cover for my current Apple Watch and this app has helped me track my swimming. I'm also glad they added a drill component. This has been very helpful. You will enjoy this app.,5,Great Option for AppleWatch Series 1
133,"I just returned to lap swimming and tried the app. It was accurate for distance, strokes and time. I wish it showed calories burned. Are you able to run the swim app and the Apple Watch workout app at the same time? The Apple Watch workout app doesn't display different strokes, but does measure calories.",4,"Good app, but needs improvement"
134,I bought a watch specifically for the swim app and workout tracking and with every upgrade it seems to get worse. Now none of my workouts at all are displayed. Needs serious QE testing. Signed disappointed swimmer!,5,Upgrades and swim workout sync are a mess
135,"When this app is working it's Awesome! It's accurate, it's user friendly, it does everything I was looking for in a swim app. I loved it!!
That's the Good. The Bad.
Lately its crashing. I've lost two swims.. one was almost complete for 3800 yards.. the other crashed twice during my swim.
The Ugly. Your customer support is 
Horrible!! It's been over a week and I've not heard a word. Are you addressing this problem? Do you even care? I'd give this app 5+ stars. 
It's that good.. but your customer follow through is awful! Please fix!",5,"The Good, the Bad and the very Ugly."
138,"After using this app for about a month, ~ 3 times a week, all performance measures noticeably improved. This has also reflected in swim style improvements that my co swimmers noticed. 

Highly recommend to all skill level swimmers.",5,Love this app - best for swimmers 👍👌👆
140,"I love the app, but consistently run in to issues with the app closing part way through my swim. This make it difficult to accurately track my workouts. 

I am running this on a 1st generation AppleWatch with a Catalyst, waterproof watch case. 

Hope they can create a more stable app.",4,Best Swim App so far
141,Got my workout exactly right even the first time. Apple's workout app never did no matter what I tried. Allows to edit workout if needed (I could remove my experimental drill). Amazed!,5,WAY better than native workout app
142,Drill mode and send off timer took a bit of time to get use to but this has become my go to app for my swim workouts.  Best app I have found for Apple Watch for tracking Swim workouts.,5,Works as expected
143,"I have been using MySwimPro since mid Janurary 2017. I am 64 years old and use it daily from my Apple Series 2 watch. It does all I need it to do and I am sure more. I just needed it to count my laps but I can see other great information like elapse time, calories and pulse. I love this app.

I have not tried all the other great parts of the app. 

The support is excellent. I had a few questions and Adam Oxner replied that day. There was an app fix the next day. 

Thanks MySwimPro team.",5,Great swim tracker
144,"Great new app. As someone who loves swimming I appreciate having this new app a lot. The app is great but definitely needs some improvements.
Since this is a new app I am giving it 5 stars and will be waiting for new releases.",5,Love it
146,Counting laps was a pain and I would always loose my count in reaching my goal each day. Now with this app I don't have to worry about it as it know exactly where I am and how much I have done.,5,Amazing
147,"I use this app all the time and really like it. The stats, number of laps, heart beat rate, everything gets counted. I only wish #of strokes would get back, disappeared after the update.",5,Great swimming app
148,This app works great! I have had no issues uploading all of my workouts from my Garmin swim watch. I also like being able to connect with the other swimmers in my club.,5,Great Swim App!!
149,"As a triathlete, this app allows me to track every single workout and is providing me with the details I need to check on my improvements. Highly recommended",5,Love it
150,"This app works great for my Apple Watch 2 for capturing all my swimming data, including drills when I'm not moving my arms. I like the detailed data breakdown, workout analysis, and accurate lap count.",5,Great Workout App
152,"Great app, very well-rounded. One of the best feature is the pool finder and seeing other people tracking their progress. Tried some other apps and like this one the best.",5,Love the pool finder feature!
153,"I've only used this app a couple of times, but so far I love everything it does. Very easy set up and use during my workouts. Check it out!",5,Awesome swim app
154,"Used it for the first time today. Great job logging the workout, easy to share and connect with others.",5,Works great with Apple Watch
155,"App works great with Apple 2 watch. My favorite parts...ability to easily select different pool sizes, the fact that it knows when I'm taking a breather. Great app!",5,Does it's job
157,"An app for the Apple Watch that is 1. Accurate 2. Allows you to select the option to do drills as you are swimming 3. Is free 4. Is awesome. 
I absolutely  recommend this app!! Very satisfied!!",5,Finally...
158,This app is great for keeping track of your workout and even motivates through friendly competition at your local pool. Works great with the new Apple Watch!!,5,Great App for Swimmers!!
159,"This is the best swim app so far. I can connect with other clubs and swimmer. Its nice to locate pools around you within the app. Finally, i can track my Swims. Cant wait to go swimming again ❤️",5,Love it!!!!!
160,"So close to perfect. I could have rated it 5 but there is room for improvement in charts, export options, data sharing with other apps, etc.",4,Very Good with Apple Watch
161,Load up your pool of choice or find one. The apps knows the size of pool.  Starts when you start.  Counts the strokes.  Splits. All totals up.  Great for all levels of swimmers.,5,Great easy app
162,Love not having to count my laps. Or forget to record them! I have been more motivated to swim since using the app.,5,Works great with my pebble time
164,"Easy to navigate, with good tracking for my personal progress. Looking forward to using the leaderboard for motivation. Hassle free device pairing.",5,Initial impressions
166,"Good way to track swimming activity. Knows when you're resting, which the Workout app isn't able to do.",4,Everything I need for daily swim
167,I found Lapse are not counted accurately recorded. I tried using distance and lap count. Distance is more accurate. The Lap count recorded each length of 25 yards/meters as 1/2 lap. It also missed more laps than distance.,4,Swim works but.....
168,"Tracked my distance, laps and rest time very accurately. Plus transferred the data to the phone from my watch correctly!  Happy!",5,Works accurately
169,"Whether you're a recreational swimmer or a competitive one, this app does it all! Definitely a great addition to my training!",5,This app is fantastic!!
172,The app works well and is reasonably accurate on lap count. Fails miserably on breast stroke. I like the drill mode for kicking and use that to handle breast stroke failing. Wish the drill mode entry of length was better.,4,Decent for the price
174,The Apple Watch 2 is decent for casual swimmers.  If you really want some detailed analysis of your workout this app is a no-brainer.,5,Must have app for Apple Watch
175,"Having used the Apple Watch app and now the Swim app, there is no comparison. Fantastic, easy to use and accurate.",5,Best on market
176,Great app! Developers did a nice job at making this app flow beautifully on the apple watch.,5,Super easy and functional
177,"UI needs a little work, but it's the most accurate tracker of distance out of all apps I've used. It's made my new Apple Watch so much more useful for me.",4,Great app!
178,"Enjoy using this tracker for my daily swims.  Like the data set shared between the app, my Apple Watch and the Health app on the iPhone.",4,Enjoy the product paired with Apple Watch
179,"Love this app for my triathlon training when I'm in the pool. Stroke rate, Swolf, distance per 100. It has everything.",5,Best swimming app for Apple Watch

196,Much better than swimpro,5,Great swim app
198,I love this app! It does so much in recording my swims,5,Great Swim App
200,"This one tracks your distance, time and heart rate. The open water course is still a mess of spaghetti due to GPS  issues but still superior to the native Apple Watch program for open water. Pool swimmers will appreciate the workouts. It is FREE! If the GPS improves would rate 5 stars. All in all I really appreciate this app. Thanks to the swim.com team!",4,Open swim better than Apple Watch
205,It is reliable and fun to use.,5,I love it :)
211,Good for me,5,Swim
212,Great,5,Great
215,"I’ve been using the swim.com app for more than a year and I like it a lot. There are however, a few points that could be improved:
- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. 
- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!",4,Nice app but still needs some bug fixes
220,"This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

Thanks.",4,Excellent app except for a couple of things
222,Good. Never opened or used but I rlly love it BEST APP EVER !!,5,Yay SWIM.com
223,I am getting into swimming and I love the Swim.com Leaderboards. I also tried other apps but the swim tracking was not as accurate as Swim.com’s proprietary tracking algorithms. Love it!!,5,The best swim tracking app!
