0,1,"I was very excited about this app, but it's totally unreliable. While it did work multiple times, when I used it to record my most important swim of the year (a 5.2km open water swim) on Galaxy watch 5, it failed to sync/upload the data. The data is there with an upload button, but it gives ""upload unsuccessful"" every time. I contacted support, but they were totally unhelpful: their recommendation was to manually enter total time/distance (and accept losing all pace & heart rate data)."
1,5,"I'd give this a 4.5 if I could. It's not a perfect app, there are some things that could be changed (a more direct way to get to your active challenges, for one). However, it works well with pretty much any fitness tracker out there, syncs nicely with Garmin/Strava. The monthly challenges are very motivating. Making the progress bar for the challenges a bit more prominent would be a nice change, too. All in all, though, this is a great app for us swimmers."
2,2,"I would love it if it was accurate. I am not sure if the problems come from my swimming style, the software, or the hardware (using a Fossil Carlyle). In addition, I would love to have the following features: - the ability to manually edit/delete swimming logs (to help correct accuracy) - clear documentation on how to connect to Google Fit ( I see the option within account settings but haven't figured out how to use it) - ability to pause workouts (improve UX to make it easily discoverable)"
3,2,"Syncing with a watch is a horrible experience. The login page does not come up every time on my phone. I've tried opening the Swim app on my phone and the WearOS app. But could only get the login screen to come up once. Then once it came up, found it the login screen doesn't include integration with my Google account. Had to delete my account and use a regular email account. Now I can't get the login screen to come back up."
4,1,"It's simply has too many issues, the watch app freezes and is a massive battery drain, the phone app freezes, and the website doesn't aggregate and average the daily, weekly and yearly distances. You have no idea what I have to go through to get the swims logged. I wish I was better at Excel and I would write a program myself."
5,2,"Overly obsessed with what pool you are in. It interferes with basic functionality. Also doesn't sync with Google fit, just allows you to export data that can be imported. Waste of time and effort."
6,5,"I have and use both a Garmin and Suunto sports watches (and Strava), and my swim data transfer seamlessly to this app. The app gives nice and clear visual display of your swim statistics, and is very easy and intuitive to use. However, I should perhaps point out that I'm only a recreational swimmer, so my needs are definitely satisfied way sooner than some pro's."
7,1,Terrible I can't even sign up because it says please accept the terms and conditions but doesn't give me the option to accept. So I can't even try it. I'm sure it's not good if you can't even create an account.
8,2,"The app is OK to use, but it has horrible support for units. There are several options to change the units from miles to meters. But so far I found not a single screen where the units are actually correct like I set them. I have it set to meters, and everywhere you can see ""y"" (probably ""yards"") where it should say ""m"". This is the same for the app and the smartwatch interface. Very annoying if you live in a country where they don't use retarded units. Contacting their support didn't help."
9,2,"All in all the app is great app with potential to be even better. The problem is the tracking accuracy! It never gets the tracks right. Whenever I go for 100yards, it thinks it was only 75 and my results look bad. When I correct it in the app, I find that one of the returns was usually not tracked. When I split the track to the correct number my results are not updated to the leadership board. I wonder how many users have that problem too and thus don't even make it into the leadership board?"
10,2,"Inaccuracy is really an issue, especially when I don't see any logical reasoning. Out of 4 routine swims, three were not right in distance, none of the four were correct in identifying strokes nor the change in laps. Also, syncing with Google Fit is useless. 2 heart points after a 1km swim without being able to edit is just wrong! Your app also thinks I rest half of my swim time. Time for the team to invest in app accuracy and take a break from making up workouts!"
11,1,"I can NOT recommend this app (for watches) & customer service/help desk I have had tried to connect my watch and it won't. I contacted the help desk -who seemed to be very helpful initially, however it has been over a month and I have not heard back (I have sent 2 follow up emails) it appears they have just put it in the 'too hard' basket. Very disappointed. If you want to track your swims I can HIGHLY recommend form swimwear, they have EXCELLENT customer service and I have had zero issues."
12,5,It works! I've been wanting a swim tracking wear OS app for a while. And now one exists. I imagine the developers had to work hard to get a swimming app on Wear OS 2 but they did it. I'm happy!
13,5,It's wary good app I very love it but I want to ask 2 improves 1 they I can set thet all kilometer/half kilometer I get short vibrate 2 some times one I stop for second in the middle of the pool because someone thet calculate it like 2 pools thenks üôè
14,4,"Generally good. There seems to be an issue with the way the app estimates energy spent swimming. Today I swam 1700m and the app reports to Strava that I expended 30,000 calories? Weird."
15,5,"For samsung wearable devices, this is the most accurate swimming app I have come across. Much better compared to speedo on and Samsung health. Works awesome with the galaxy watch. Only downside I have is that for some reason, once you launch the app it turns the watch brightness to max. Wish it didnt but It's not much of a big deal. On the gear 2pro, the display could use some tweaking though. You can't scroll through pages once water lock is on; it does not scroll automatically either. All in all, It's a great app and would highly recommend it."
16,5,I like the workouts too much because it go with u in the water in the watch and be as coch swim beside u I just want more workouts for beginners Between 1 and 1.5 km during 45 to 60 minutes
17,1,"I liked the app when I was just tracking my swims but when I started wanting to use the workouts I got incredibly frustrated. All of the workouts are in yards even though I specifically have it set to meters, ok fine I thought, I can just create my own workouts... Well technically yes, but if you don't swim it immediately well then it disappears. There is no way to save it, other than send yourself a PDF of it but I DO NOT WANT A PDF! If I wanted a PDF I would have just typed the damn thing!"
18,3,"Having tested for a couple of weeks, here are my impressions: 1.) Much better detection than S health with the galaxy watch. 2.) Freestyle, fly and backstroke are detected accurately, but breaststroke is not captured at all in my case, whereas it is with S health. 3.) I am finding myself having to re-athorize synchronization to Google fit after every swim or it is not synced. 4.) Ideally implementing synchronization to S health would be great to avoid using Health Sync."
19,5,"I have used this app to record swims, manually, through my USMS FLOG, and from my Swim2 watch through Garmin Connect. Mostly this was seamless, but when it wasn't the support team was a big help. The support team is super. They are responsive and listen to suggestions well. This is the only app that I know of, where I can fix the mistakes that I made using my watch in the pool. I can also adjust when the watch reads my stroke wrong. This is the go to app for looking at what I actually did."
20,1,"Edit: 23 Nov Upgraded to a Samsung Active 2 and the latest app version consistently freezes when trying to end a swim, loosing the entire record in the process, only syncs 2 swims ... Samsung Health automatically tracks all swims ... Latest version update of the app does not install on Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro, after old version worked more or less fine for months. Very little information on potential trouble shooting and no fallback solution, e.g. option to download/install previous version."
21,2,"App is the best available swimming tracker for Wear OS. But it‚Äôs not great, especially compared to tomtom or garmin. Accuracy is poor, rest feature may not recognise beginning of the swim. Screen may unlock and lock back showing stats from previous swim. Bugs, bugs and more bugs. App is far away from being usable."
22,5,Great app. Love the option to do pre-loaded workouts or simply record your swim.
23,2,"A good 10% - 20% out on every swim. Sometimes over, sometimes under, with no rhyme or reason. Inaccurate nearly to the point of uselessness. Interface is annoying and glitchty. It's impossible to see the lap count when you've got goggles on."
24,2,"I must be missing something because I am finding no value to this app. It's not syncing with my Garmin connect, the workout selection is a bit subpar, it feels very redundant. I'll just stick with the Garmin platform because there's no way I'm buying a watch just for swimming when the app isnt great. Two stars for trying"
25,5,"All I want is swim tracking. Strokes, rest times, number of laps and distance traveled. Initially I was having trouble with accuracy. I had terrific response from the app developers. The app is getting better and better and better. Thanks"
26,2,"Good start. Long way to go. Ease of use is OK (long lists of swimmers show v bad performance) . It's really a swim log viewer app rather than providing anything insightful. Analytical aspect is very weak. Needs to show progress over time such as best times (not just average) for various distances so you can see if you're improving and by how much. I'd like to see, by distance, my 1st 2nd 3rd best times. And for any set I'd like to see where it ranks for me by time (day, week, month, year)."
27,2,"Doesn't record all your swims even though the same swims are documented on other apps. I just swam yesterday and it didn't log on this app, but logged to Garmin and Strava just fine as usual. Talked to support and got a weak response that basically made it seem like the reason it didn't record my swim was because I was trying to record something other than a swim. Nice. No..... your app just doesn't work as good as it should. Deleting."
28,5,"I got to workout for the last months of 2018 using this app and achieved my resolution to swim more that year. This 2019, I'm upping my game!! It's pretty awesome to choose workouts then try them out to find what's comfortable, doable and challenging. I can't bring my phone to the pool so I download, print, secure in a waterproof pouch and go. And it auto syncs with my Garmin Vivoactive HR."
29,2,"I have a Samsung Galaxy Watch 46mm. currently I'm swimming in a 38ft private pool. I swim laps for a mi several days a week. I don't do swimmers turns. the yardage measuremeant is way off. it might be my fault as I don't do a snap turn but touch the wall turn and take off instead of maybe pausing and starting back up. I would like to see this app allow for brief break each lap, to let water out of goggles, take a couple breaths, etc. example swam looked at watch it said 100yds swam more still 100"
30,2,"The app is slow, cumbersome, un-intuitive, and archaic looking. It tries to use the GPS constantly even if you tell it not to. It sometimes doesn't sync properly with Garmin Connect so you have to manually add the .fit file."
31,4,"Excellent swim app, calculates your stroke automatically and easily adds drills. It would get five stars but for the following 2 points. There have been isolated issues where workouts have not uploaded from the watch and also, a useful addition would be a calorie burn number."
32,1,"Swim app was absolutely great on my Galaxy Watch 1, having recorded around 40kilometres of pool swims....however it is utter rubbish on my galaxy watch 4. The menus have all changed and are a mess. Did a swimmer write these menu screens? I think not. You need direct menu choices such as pool length, start, stop, bpm, length count, this app just means you need to stop mid swim to prat about with navigating too many screen options, and how the he'll do you click the bezel to end the swim session!!"
33,4,Stopped working on the Fossil Gen 5 all of a sudden. Had to reset and now the watch is not compatible. I had a lot of swims saved and now I can't track them any longer. And now it's fixed. Better communication would help but thanks for the fix.
34,3,"very poorly designed. only been able to add one workout to my Wear OS watch. won't let me delete it or add a new one. extremely difficult to find new workouts. always reverts my settings to ""Never"" when i try to find a workout. only using this app cause it barely tracks my swims"
35,1,Got Issues This app worked great for over a year on two different Samsung watches. The last month however it has failed miserably. No as I am trying to finish my swim the app stops working and fails to remember my swim. The last 4 to 5 swims nothing. I go to history and it is gone. Please help love the app but doesn't work anymore. (Samsung Active 2)
36,1,"Waste of storage on my Gear Active...went back to native app. Clunky app that doesn't connect well between wearable and phone. Does a poor job of tracking the swim (no stroke detection), the native app on the Samsung Gear is just as detailed and works like a dream."
37,3,"Good enough so far, but haven't really used the Wear OS integration. But it's not good for non-imperial people, since 90% of the workouts are in weird yards instead of meters - it just doesn't show anything for me in a 25m pool ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
38,4,Just got a Google fit watch and this is the only app I've found that will work on it to track swims. Easy to use but remember to turn the app on before you start then log your results on the Google fit app it won't do it automatically like my old fitbit used to! Also it gives you alot of different stats like rest time but it won't tell you how many calories you've burned you need to work that out yourself. Overall a good app I just hope the devs make it even better!
39,2,"Latest update seems to have broke it a bit on Galaxy Watch 4, seems to only be recording half my swim. Looks like it just stays in resting when you restart occasionally. Oddly its more accurate for initial lengths by seemingly recording less when it used to over estimate but you could just merge your lengths back down."
40,5,"Incredible pairing with Google Pixel watch. Stroke recognition is right about 75% of the time. In the app, you can adjust anything it didn't get right to make your workout history accurate. Honestly this app has motivated me to swim more."
41,5,"Rare rarely gets the distance on an interval wrong. I would love the ability to customize screens (rest timer, etc.), but this is the best swim app I could find for my Pixel watch so I'm giving it 5 stars."
42,3,"It is not perfect. I swim only freestyle and often times it says I am swimming another stroke, usually backstroke. It also misses lengths if I cool down with breaststroke. Today it added a length I did not swim. For the most part it does OK. I use a Gear Sport. It also would be nice if it hooked up with Samsung Health."
43,5,"So far best app at tracking laps with gear fit2pro. Measures laps accurately. Has drill mode to help pacing laps with vibrations. I only wish it could pace strokes. Browser UI clear, all the stats are there as graphs and tables and details up for editing."
44,3,Unfortunately with the latest Android 10 and version of the app/tinzen is very buggy. I can no longer reliably enter and exit water lock mode when switching between drill mode and swim without app getting stuck between swiping screens on galaxywatch. App then crashes and swim data is lost.
45,1,"Useless on my Samsung Active2. Current version of 2.0.3 doesnt not sync with phone app. Cust serv said 2.0.4 will fix this..... great, but it isn't available on the google play store so it doesn't do anyone any good. This is stupid stuff that should have been flushed out in QA. Industry uses 2 week software sprints and CICD get with the program Swim!"
46,5,"Great so far. Speedo finally quit, so I had to switch. Once I found where to stop my workout, it was great. Love the colors (visible underwater), and the layout. I wish it had laps, but easily converted from yards."
47,5,"Accurate,all info I need. Splits come up automatically. One issue is everything abbreviated, can be tough read. And doesn't allow a delete or clear when logged. At least not that I see. Minor problems aside, stellar.üëçüí™üç∫üèä"
48,1,"Created log in thru app, tried to connect my Samsung watch. Went to account menu like directed and got no code. Tried to log in thru web site. Told PW wrong. Tried to request reset. Never received and email. App is totally useless. If just getting connected takes that many steps, I can not imagine what the app it self is like NOT USER FRIENDLY!"
49,3,Loved this app and all the data it gave until the data it created was no longer accessible online. Its very difficult to edit and view data on the app. I lodged a support ticket to find out if this was permanent and heard nothing back. Hugely disappointing!
50,1,Watch data doesn't sync with phone. Error 60. Will go back to Samsung.
51,5,"Swim tracking just got a huge upgrade on my Galaxy Watch - much better than the stock swim app from S health. Swolf, HR, Distance till goal is all but a bezel rotation away ! üòé Not a single touchscreen smartwatch can do swimming data this conveniently - the bezel + this app is amazing !"
52,2,"Samsung watch 4. Uncomfortable to use. The best way for the watch app is to freeze the touch sensor, but be always on main screen. With the besel turn it switches between, main face, description. To finish a training you have to unblock swimm mod."
53,3,I track my swims on my Samsung galaxy active. I have found it to be fairly accurate most of the time. However tonight I finished my swim and my watch kept telling me to turn the bezel to end my swim. My watch doesn't have a bezel. Usually I just have to press the top right button to end but it wouldn't allow me. I ended up turning my watch off and therefore my swim was not recorded!
54,3,"Swim reading was quite inaccurate. It did not read my breast strokes at all and it shows that I did back strokes which I didn't. It works at first but now, it only accurately measure freestyle accurately. Im using a Galaxy Watch to track all these."
55,1,I tried to swim with this app a few times. The app is really bad and very difficult to end a swim. I lost all my exercise data. What a waste of time is this app. I hope the Samsung galaxy watch 3 improves their standard swimming app quickly.
56,5,"Combined with Fossil Sport and WearOS, this is great app. Very accurate in recording length of swim. Still trying to figure out how to do kick with drill mode. Love the integration with Strava."
57,1,"Only recognizes freestyle or some kind of ""mixed"". Doesn't recognize turns properly -> sometimes over and sometimes underestimates distance. Didn't record HR at all, although my watch did measure HR and could show it in its own app."
58,3,"Not very accurate but only option on Wear OS at present. Needs to be better though at just the basics of knowing whether I'm swimming or resting, and assuming if I'm moving in a 25m pool that after 4 minutes swimming I've probably done more than 50m!."
59,5,Great app to track your own swimming workouts and excellent user interface on smartwatch Galaxy 4
60,2,The app does accept feeds from Garmin Connect and maybe even Strava. The app created a location for me that I am unable to modify. The app created a 27 yard pool for me (my regular pool is SCY). The app tried to link to my USMS account but could not/would not accept my email address for the link up.
61,5,"Best swimming app for Android Wear. Syncs well with Google FIt. Also like how it automatically turns on touch lock to avoid accidental touches when coming in contact with water, an issue I used to face all the time."
62,3,Works with US Master Swimming And Garmin very well. Been using for a few years. Does not actually support Challenges as a tab like the directions say it should. Wanted to acknowledge a Fall Series 1 mile Challenge but can see how.
63,4,I connect it to my Samsung Galaxy watch but it skips intervals sometimes
64,1,"Wow, this app is really bad. I tried to connect it to garmin, it just gave me the pinwheel of death. I tried to add strava, it wouldn't let me add it because I sign up with Google and Google doesn't find their browser secure. So... I have to put everything directly..."
65,5,"Very good swim tracker. Mild learning curve to fully utilize all the features but can be used easily ""right out of the box."""
66,5,Good app very precise. It doesn't recognize breaststroke on gear sport but the intervals are full editable so it's easy to fix. Best swimming app in the market at the moment for Samsung wearables
67,5,Over all works good with my Samsung active watch. Training program on my watch while in the pool is a great advantage! I would add an option to write the program online on a PC instead of on my mobile phone.
68,3,"Best of the available options, but can randomly loose an entire swimming session as I interact with it on the watch, and there is no way to export record's to CSV etc."
69,5,Great but sometimes loses or gains a lap
70,5,Great swim tracker when paired with the wearable app. Currently using an Apple watch that syncs to an old iPhone which updates on my Android app. Would be better if I had an android watch but this does work.
71,5,Pretty simple to use. Counts the laps accurately. Love the ability to do sets of a workout. Samsung watch vibrates to let me know when to go.
72,1,I'm not sure how much useless this can get. want me to open apple on phone to pair but no pin number. if you have a Samsung wearable use speedo on. at least you can record you lengths when swimming. this app is beyond help it all went wrong in han then update it got even worse. my pairing cider us a letter and 3 dots. submit ticket and the√±......
73,3,I was looking for the workouts feature but there's not much to see. It synced only one of my swims with Garmin connect. This can totally beat myswimpro just by adding default workouts.
74,1,Highly inaccurate at tracking number of lengths. says I've done way more than I have. Complete faff to end swim as well as the back button also activates Samsung Pay.
75,5,Can't fault it really. And it syncs Strava. Thankfully it runs in the background as Samsung Health doesn't and needs to be on the screen. I would rather this on display but Samsung is rubbish.
76,5,An excellent swimming application. It will carry out all of your requests. I enjoy the Send to Device feature since it makes choosing a workout on my watch faster. üí´
77,1,No settings tab. Cannot add my wearable - menu is greyed out.
78,5,"Love using this app for swimming much better than samsung health. Only problem I have is the app puts the full brightness up on my Galaxy Watch 46 so every time I end a swim I have to turn the watch brightness back down, apart from that it's great."
79,4,"Great app, works flawlessly on my TicWatch Pro 3 GPS. Accurate and also has heart beat, both of which the default app couldn't do! One suggestion, dark mode on the phone app would be nice #nitpick only!"
80,5,I'm using swimming to get fit and lose weight. This app and the app for the galaxy watch really helps push me to my max and makes me want to do better each time I swim. Without it I would have given up by now. So thank you!
81,4,The new wear os integration is a massive improvement. Nice work. Still doesnt seem to link that well to Google fit. But im sure thats fixable.
82,1,"With the galaxy 4 watch, the app either does not count laps at all, or it looses the whole workout when you turn off the water lock to stop the workout."
83,1,"Doesn't track workout on galaxy watch 4. Difficult to get workouts to sync to watch, then deletes them when you turn off the water lock."
84,1,"Awful UX on the app. Even worse on the wear os app. Has dropped 3 / 7 swims, never synced never to be seen again. Algorithm is awful and always gets my swims wrong by 25m."
85,5,I have really been enjoying this app and tracking my open water feed. I am super excited about the new update today that shows open water leaderboards This will really make virtual competitions and personal tracking so much easier
86,2,"The update messed up the data vizualisation, which was not great to begin with, but now it's shown somehow reversed. Please fix."
87,1,"To hard to use. You can't just track your stroke on any pool, and you can't add a new one coz location option is broken."
88,1,Didnt even get to use it. Once installed it took over the screen on my watch. Only way I could stop it was to restart my watch. I opened up the app and it did exactly the same this. I have unstalled it
89,5,This app is fantastic...I love being able to edit my swims. My galaxy watch 3 is not the most accurate but I can merge my lengths easily..gives good overall swim info.
90,3,"Tracks swim well on watch, but functionality there is very limited - can't upload some activities and no way to delete them (and clean up) on watch."
91,1,I log a swim (no watch) and change the time and the app changes my distance. I can either have correct time or correct distance not both.
92,1,"This just doesn't work on my Fossil Gen 5. Installed on my phone and watch, but could NOT get them to communicate. Though I was logged into the App, the watch just kept saying to Log In or Join. Tried multiple times before giving up."
93,1,"Terrible, When attempting to sign up - you have to enter your age, the only way to do it is by moving one month at a time, I am 50 - 2010-1973=37x12= 444 - tap the screen 444x just to enter my age, you've got to be kidding me ü§∑üèª I uninstalled the app"
94,4,I really like the metrics of the app. And I find it more reliable for stroke counts and ease of use than the native swimming app in the Galaxy Watch.
95,5,"It took a little while to get used to it, and I don't think it's always accurate, but it's still really handy and fun to use. At first it didn't recognize my breast consistently, but I got more careful with technique and it works!"
96,5,"I love the app. Beautiful design, useful stats that give needed info for a workout analysis, interesting challenges. I recommend this app to my friends."
97,5,"Update March 14/22: the WearOS app on the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is now working just fine. Needed to turn on ""Allow Background Activity"" for the app in the Wear app on your phone. I'm back to loving this app!"
98,4,"The app works and measure the strokes, but I have an issue with the meters. It remain counting meters although I am resting o still floating in the same place."
99,3,Works well for sustained swims. Seems confused by intervals with varying effort. Ignores kick sets altogether.
100,1,I have a galaxy watch 5 pro and the latest swim apps installed. Swam 1375 yards then the app crashed the wearOS and lost all my workout data. Did the same thing yesterday after 500 yards. It happened during swimming
101,1,"Will not pair with the galaxy watch. You enter the code and it just hangs before taking you back to the same screen asking for the code, and the watch says pairing failed. useless."
102,5,great app which is for free and have all features as the commercial apps. Counts the laps very accuratly (25m and 50m pools) and recognisizes the swim stlyle. Im using Samsung Gear Fit2
103,1,"After Speedo shut down, I have been looking for a decent open water swim app. This one is hopeless on the Gear S3. It keeps recording my open water swims as 1 or two laps of a pool."
104,3,"Does not record the lengths properly. Sometimes records I have completed 2 when I infact swam 1, use to be fine but lately not good at all ."
105,3,Ii have used this app for years and it's never missed a lap. Upgraded to new Samsung 4 classic and today's swim was out by about 15 laps! Not sure if watch or app to blame :)
106,5,love the accuracy and stats. now if there is a way to get a workout loaded it would be perfect.
107,3,"The app need to optimised in order to record the real distance. In my case, 10% to 15 % of the recorded distance is not real. Comparation made with Form Googles."
108,1,Very user unfriendly. Since it's the only app I can find that tracks my laps while swimming I stick for now.
109,2,"Very difficult to end App. Lost all my info on 1 swim. Did 20m and showed I did 120m very frustrating try to end swim, do much do, I am deleting."
110,3,App is pretty good. Functional but a bit clunky w/ sync between watches and app on phone.
111,2,Great concept if it worked. App will freeze around 1000 yd and you'll lose your swim workout. Happened with my galaxy watch 4
112,4,"Really happy to find this app. Just getting back to swimming after 40 years and needed something to keep me from getting bored and setting some goals. And, it's free!"
113,5,Wear OS app is fantastic! Thanks for providing Strava integration and ability to specify smaller pool sizes (14 yards).
114,5,"The best app to follow the sport activities. Besides swimming, it also log on more activities: Running, cycling, yoga.... Great!"
115,5,The Strava integration stopped working! Works perfectly on my Galaxy Active. It gets the meters and strokes very accurate as any garmin or suunto
116,3,"Probably an issue with wear os or my watch, but it rarely counts the distance correctly and always needs to get resynced with Google fit"
117,5,This app works great with my Garmin. It takes very little effort and I know that it's accurate when it uploads to the system.
118,4,Is the best swim app I've tried . Only 8issue 8s after I have finished swim and stopped app it remains on my samsung gear screen so I have to turn watch off and on .
119,3,"great app, but often incorrectly measures distance. Over the course of 2km app can be up to 3 laps out (150m)"
120,3,"1. The pool location is only show for pool in hotel. It should show outside hotel as well for example in the arena. 2. Can't edit title 3. Can't add province/address ( fyi : I'm in Jakarta Indonesia) Hope you can tell me if i'm wrong thanks, Ronald"
121,5,"Really nice to have a stroke log, and it seamlessly ties in with Garmin Connect app, so it's nice to have for post swim eval."
122,3,A lot to improve features. More facile app and of course supporting unicode characters.
123,5,This app is amazing. Using the workouts in the app has helped me really focus on improving various parts of my swim.
124,1,"Swam for 30 minutes, but the app only recorded 175 meters. Wildly inaccurate (Fossil Explorist gen4), and therefore useless."
125,3,"this is a great app dont get me wrong, but if i accidently add a set to a workout im creating, i cant delete that set, or maybe you can and i dont know how"
126,5,"Best swim app providing meaningful metrics. Pity they do not support Fitbit Versa watch, had to buy Galaxy Gear Sport to use and scrap my Versa."
127,4,"GOOD App..Captures Every Lap...Great Grafics..connected to Goggle & FB account..Records my swimming like January to December.. Every day is Sunday (it's Commplement)..I Feel Motivated to exel & Go Further..,Honestly Google Play Achievement point Motivate extra..so üëâüëà Overall Enjoyable & Worth Trying..& Exprinceing it.."
128,3,Downloading issues with Samsung Gear Sport watch.
129,3,is not accurate at all!
130,5,this has worked really well for me. it counys my laps and measures my swolf. i had some issues but the delevoper helped me righy away. great service!
131,1,"Disastrously designed. No way to ask for help, or figure out how to solve problems yourself. Don't be like me, wasting hours trying to get USMS challenges to work when they didn't work right away."
132,1,Doesn't save swims - says they upload then are nowhere to be found. Cannot even see them in history of swims.
133,3,I am giving this three star because I cannot track my swim. when I finished it says 0 yards and put zeros on everything please improve this it's very disappointing
134,5,Good app. It would be great if the data transferred on to samsung health automatically!
135,5,"Tracks and stores pool swim practice info. Tracks and stores open water swim info. Join groups and participate in virtual competition. Compare to other swimmers by age, gender and type. Filter results by pool, group, time period. Distance total and timed swims by stroke and distance. Download and follow practice sets from device during swims."
136,2,It's a good attempt but very off on the actual distance completed. I swam a 200yds and it recorded 75yds
137,1,Couldn't get past the sign up page. Just tweaked out over and over tried reload etc. Android Phone 2022 moto g stylus 5g
138,2,"The watch app on Samsung Active2, crashing continually. I love the app when it works properly"
139,4,"Connected with gear fit2 pro. lap count, distance, duration, pace, strokes, HR etc. but where is the start time and end time, calorie burned?"
140,1,"Can't connect watch app to mobile app, it keeps sending me to play store even though latest app installed on watch and phone"
141,3,"i like it but i miss the hr values/calories burnt calculation, because my watch allows live hr during the activitie (fit gear 2 pro)."
142,5,I use the app with the Galaxy Watch. it awesome and seems to be accurate to 50m over 1500m.
143,1,"The pebble app still works great, but the android app has dropped the ability to upload swims."
144,2,Do not save data to app from Samsung galaxy watch 3 after swimming. Drill battery very much.
145,3,This seems pretty accurate but can this be paired with Samsung health so the workouts are added to others on there ?
146,1,Doesn't work on my Fossil Gen 6 watch. It only records between 4-6 minutes and between 25-225 meters in total.
147,5,Great app. Hopefully someday it will sync naturally with Samsung Health.
148,1,Every swim I did registered on my Fossil Gen 5 but then vanished straight away. 4 times in a row. Nothing online for support. Very disappointed....
149,1,This app is terrible for logging your times. It's strictly meant for you to share times with others.
150,5,Easily the best swimming app for Android. Works with my Pixel Watch too!
151,5,Never drops lengths or randomly stopping like the Samsung app on my watch.
152,1,Does not work with Galaxy Watch 4. Simply do not start recording the workout.
153,1,"The workouts are not there anymore, all filters are empty"
154,3,Has trouble with pebble watches. Used to work but has trouble now.
155,5,Great app that tracks my swims and helps to keep me motivated..
156,5,Works well on Galaxy Watch 4 tracking lengths in indoor pool. Linking well to strava.
157,5,One of the best apps that I have used so far. Really good and has good workouts
158,3,It only detects freestyle and never detects breaststroke.
159,1,Poor. Even with all the filters open no workouts shown
160,5,"Easy app keeps data, user friendly & does what you want"
161,1,Make sure you can count lengths and work out your distance because this app can't!
162,5,Everything is fine. Sometimes it couts courses improperly but we can live with it
163,1,Will not log me in. It acts like it's loading my profile and then freezes.
164,1,Unable to connect Gear Fit2 pro. Frustrating.
165,5,Works great. Helps me transfer my swim data from garmin to google fit.
166,1,First swim it recorded nothing....2nd swim recorded 60yds instead of 600yds. Samsung Gear Sport. Going to install Speedo and hope for better :(
167,1,the app could not even track anything with my Galaxy Active watch.
168,5,able to customize so many aspects of workout tracking
169,4,simple to use and good interface
170,1,"What an idiot made app for fit2 pro, impossible to shutdown. No stat I see on phone app. Very bad!"
171,5,Great for tracking my swims even without a GPS watch
172,4,Accurately records laps. Data is great
173,4,Great tracking app with a Samsung Gear Fit Pro 2.
174,4,Good app for workouts and challenges
175,5,"Easy to use app and navigate, keeps me in check on my progress"
176,5,This app is pretty accurate in detecting my swim workout
177,5,Love the app... Finally an app that tracks my swims accurately
178,5,Accurate lap counts. Good interface
179,5,Superb app thanks
180,4,"works well, almost no missed laps"
181,5,Amazing display of all stats! üòç
182,1,Workouts are not working. I did everything that I could do but it doesn't work
183,1,Cannot change to metres Too complicated to use app with Syrava
184,5,Great app better than garmin 1 for swimming
185,1,Suddenly cant pair watch app to phone app
186,4,Reliable and interesting results
187,1,Won't let you log a swim at some point. - useless
188,1,Doesn's work on Wear OS 3.2 (Fossil sport)
189,1,not user friendly. no provisions for open water swimming.
190,4,Sometimes doesn't sink swims from watch.
191,5,Works great in pixel watch!
192,4,As a beginner this is easy App to use.
193,4,I have 1 prob i dont have a smartwatch can i still use the app?
194,4,good app. accurate swims.
195,5,why is my Surname (that I've had for 50 years) not accepted on my profile? i find this offencive! Unlike my surname which is NOT offencive! It means taking the Helm or Protective!!
196,5,With Galaxy Watch.. Love it!
197,2,Battery runs low fast Application crashes frequently.
198,1,Absolutely inaccurate. 300m counted of 500m.
199,1,Crashes every time.
200,5,One of the best fitness apps I have used!
201,4,I have a couple of comments but generally it's better than inbuilt Samsung app.
202,5,Love the automatic syncing from my Garmin watch
203,5,Very helpful for virtual coaching
204,1,tried and tried to record a swim... wouldnt let me.
205,1,Doesn't work with Fitbit sense... Sad
206,1,Why cant i screenshot my swim any more due to a privacy policy Spoiled it for me
207,1,Why is my Fossil Gen 4 smartwatch not campatible for this app?
208,1,doesn't work with pebble and uses rediculous retarded measuring system
209,5,Very compreensive statistics
210,1,Can't even open app
211,4,Can't live without this app!
212,5,"great app, very accurate"
213,1,Google fit integration is broken
214,1,Send notices to them..never reply...wont work as they say...don't bother
215,5,Great app for swimmers!
216,5,Best swim tracking app
217,5,Needs a little tweaking.
218,1,Will not send my swim history back from galaxy watch
219,1,Not compatible with Vapor 2.
220,4,Very good package
221,1,Rubbish when used with samsung watch 4
222,5,A great app!
223,4,Much better than speedon
224,1,Doesn't work on fossil wear
225,5,I am glad with this App
226,5,Great swimming app
227,5,New things for me. Honest distance.
228,2,No place with pool
229,5,Best swim app
230,4,great so far
231,4,My go to swimming app
232,5,very good!!
233,1,Para nada intuitiva.
234,5,Great App!
235,4,üôÇüôÇüëåüëå
236,5,Great!!
237,1,not working
238,2,I used to love this app now it freezes at the end of my workout and then all my workout info disappears
239,5,Cool
240,5,Great app
241,5,Prompt feedback
242,5,Nice app
243,5,Great app
244,5,Good
245,5,Great
246,1,"Given Android Wear compatibility with Fossil Sport is advertised, I'm disappointed with the current version. It doesn't know where I'm swimming despite GPS and a database of pools. The watch is incredibly inaccurate at tracking my swim, tonight's 2km was only recorded as 1.5km. I'm hoping these are just small software problems that can be rectified soon, it has so much promise! App lacks material design and any link to Google Fit that provides any accurate/meaningful data to my workout journal."
247,5,Very good
248,5,Excellent
249,4,great
250,5,Love it!!
251,4,good
252,5,great app
253,4,"Just started using it again after two years, looks like some nice updates have been done."
254,5,excellent app with my smart watch
255,4,This app has improved greatly over the years. It could still be better at the social side.
256,5,Awesome app that keeps me motivated. Connected to my Pebble. Hopefully they keep up their support of the Pebble. Update 1/10/19: sadly support for Pebble has ended. Hopefully the developers can add it back because it was working non-stop for me. I don't understand why they would remove a working feature. I even uploaded my last workout on 1/8/19. It's such a shame! This truly is a great app and maybe the developers will take pity on me and other Pebblers and support Pebble again.
257,5,Could better support Pebble watch at least save the watch type settings... 2019 despite the fact that that the application does not support them as much anymore I have been surprised to see my latest uploaded automatically this morning so I give it back out five star
258,3,Does not work with Samsung Galaxy Watch. Will not pair. Have a fully waterproof watch that I want to swim with. Used to think that app was great. Please update asap. Thanks
259,5,The app is working as intended now on Sony Smartwatch 3. Thanks for the fix
260,3,"This is the best app at mostly accurately counting my laps. Terrible at 
breaking up intervals. Example: Even though I flip at each turn it will 
show I swam 4x25 instead of 200. Does not distinguish between strokes. I 
like that i can force it to count drills so kick sets aren't lost. Overall, 
I have to spend a lot of time editing my workouts after it uploads. It also 
takes a long time before it uploads on my phone. Sometimes half a day. I 
use this with Gear Sport."
261,1,No longer installs into Sony smartwatch 3.
262,1,Latest version crashes on SmartWatch 3
263,4,Ok
264,2,"Tried this app with three Casio WSD-F20 smart watch. Useless, the developer 
promised it would work after updates but it's probably worse. All I want is 
an app that can accurately track my lengths, this one doesn't do that."
265,4,"Works ok with the pebble time. Doesn't recognise breast-stroke or drills. 
Otherwise works great"
266,4,"With Samsung Gear Sport. This is the best of the swimming apps I've tried 
in terms of accuracy."
267,5,Works great with Sony smart watch 3
268,4,"Works well now. Sometimes inaccurate, seems you need to avoid moving your 
watch hand when approaching pool edge"
269,4,Awesome well designed app. Does it sync with new Samsung Gear?
270,3,"Great idea. Needs sync with Samsung Health and Map My Run. So far it gets the distance correct most of the time, unlike Speedo On or S Health, but it does not always detect my strokes correctly (Samsung Gear Sport). I get freestyle or unknown. At least I can edit this on the website and in the app (took me a while to find out how). Also the app is very slow to load each section. Looking forward to updates."
271,1,"I was really excited to start using this off-season. I opened the app and creates my account, but it won't let my last name contain the word ""ecchi"" in it. My last name is Carnesecchi. I'm not going to change my last name, this is very aggravating"
272,5,This app is great
273,1,This app seems to not work with the new the misfit vapor or fossil q sport control. It requires you to press the only physical button and the watches already have prebuilt functions for it that make it impossible to use
274,5,At last it works for me v2.0.1  good job
275,3,"The latest version has a completely new interface, but no added functionality pre-swim - it is in fact less intuitive to use. I can't figure out how to change the pool anymore, unless this feature has been removed altogether?  More data & analysis are now available after a swim, and although it may take getting used to the new interface, I think that's a nice addition. Using Sony Smartwatch 3."
276,1,The New version sucks.  Bring back the old one.  Editing is too hard.  Rest periods are now counted as a lap.  The visual appeal is completely gone.   I would give the old version 5 stars.  Really a giant step backwards.
277,3,New version sucks battery now.
278,4,"Overall it is a good application considering it is free, it still has few problems. I am using a Nixon Mission with android wear 2.0, my hardware button works for theater mode but the app does not start if the display setting is not at always on. I can not change the yards to meters on the watch but can fix this with phone app. Still it is anoying. I tried it in 4 different day none count the whole labs the best was 10% off, it counts the srokes etc. but miss a turn and adds all the remaining turns as a single lap. Finaly ftom a computer I managed to add my watch to phone app but now I have nixon and android watch saperetly and only the android watch works if I try the nixon icon it opens a web describing how to transfer data from a germin watch. Hope some of these can be fixed in upcoming updates. I especially need an accurate lap count and meter option selectable on the watch."
279,3,"Used this on a Pebble Steel for about 2 years with weird synchronisation problems. EDIT 23/8 - Am now using a Nixon Mission on Android Wear 2.0. Surprisingly I can still put the watch into theater mode despite what official support site says - with two presses of the button. I've done three swims so far. Sad to say, the tracking's been a total mess. Using the app to merge intervals and laps, I've managed to fix one workout, but was forced to delete two workouts which were unfixable (where I swam the speed of an Olympic champion, or across the lap in 3 strokes).  EDIT 15/9 - Discovered that the previous problems was due to swimming with hand paddles. If I swim without hand paddles, the tracking seems to detect the laps and strokes pretty accurately (tested across 3 swim sessions), and only gets the intervals wrong which is fixable in the app later. So now I am forced to swim without hand paddles in order to get my tracking data correctly."
280,3,"The app was working mostly with my Sony smartwatch 3 until late Jan, now it just won't upload my workout at all.  Not sure what's going on as it was working fine before.  I hope they can fix it soon as it is totally useless now  Update:. I have to uninstall and reinstall to get upload to work and I have to do it every 2 to 3 days.  It is also crashing a lot more during swim so it lost all my current swim data"
281,1,"Indeed unusable with Android 2. It does not make sene to wait for an update from Android. There is already a theater mode, although it is not triggered by double tap. Currently, you need to swiping down, but it is impossible to do this when the swim app is open."
282,4,"Works well with my Pebble, and gives me fairly accurate stroke/lap counts and times. Occasionally takes a little while to sync but the in-app explanation is pretty clear!"
283,2,"So buggy. Editing a manually entered workout is almost impossible, defaults to a random pool I've never heard of then cannot be changed, and deleting a workout is completely impossible, have to go to desktop to do it"
284,3,"The app has always been a bit slow to use, but it looks like the new versions of this and the Pebble app have broken the connection so I can't synchronise my swims from my watch. I fear Pebble will no longer be a supported device though."
285,5,Love this app. Keeps track of what I do. Syncs with Garmin Connect easy
286,1,Incompatible with Android Wear 2.0 because it depends on the removed double-tap to enter theater mode gesture.
287,1,"Asks the length of the pool, but cannot calculate distance by lengths of laps you swam."
288,2,"Not accurate at tracking distance, which makes it pretty useless."
289,3,"What is an *achievement* for, if you don't tell me how fast I was?"
290,1,"Unable to login, fail."
291,5,Very good and reliable app
292,5,"Really good app, latest couple of updates have fixed a couple of the bugs and it no longer seems to ""drop"" any sessions. Would be good to have the number of lengths displayed rather than total distance swam (my pool is 43 yrds so going of distance swam is hard). Works well with my SM3 and Huawei p9. Would be great if it could remember my default pool again, it remembers the default length but not the venue. Thanks for the continued development, its saved me buying a garmin for pool training!"
293,4,Works again with smartwatch after update. Nice app. The home pool should be default. Everytime I have to set my home pool from yards to meters.
294,4,Kind of works for me. Pebble is a bit inaccurate as a lap counter etc.
295,3,"Support fixed my pixel xl and Nixon issue, thanks. Round watchfaces next?"
296,4,"Good app. Suggestion, add All swim personal best"
297,5,Intriguing app. All you need to do is swim and everything comes alive
298,2,"I used this on my Oneplus 3 with Sony Smartwatch 3. This app keeps crashing consistently on my phone, whenever I open ""Deivces"" submenu to upload my swimming data from Sony Smartwatch 3. I have also noticed crashes on my watch some times while swimming. I created a support ticket. Initially it was dealt by some support guy, later no response from them.  Good app, only if it works :("
299,4,"Overall I like it. There are some missing features like integration with Google fit. It also stop working during workout, but as I said overall it does job good. Just continue to work on the app. There are still a lot to be done."
300,4,Functional but does not play nice with my pebble. I lose workouts in the ether and it's annoying.
301,2,At first I had difficulty to correct my location and change from yard to meter. Figured out can do it thru web. Suggestion: integration with Google Fit; add the session start and end time to the logs.  Update: very inaccurate lap counting with my smart watch 2. That makes it useless.
302,3,"Lately beginning to see bugs here folks. On Sony Smart Watch 3, 1. Time will start but no meters clocking up. 2. Look again meters have added on after 300m. 3. All good back to normal, then boom, all current data lost, and default back to zero on the watch whilst swimming.4 Sync data hoping my previous 800m swim is there, no sync, data lost. 5. Did test on water for 5 secs,when syncing shows all, zeros on app. Any on else same dramas? Software issue? Watch issue?"
303,1,"The app is greatly designed on the phone but once on my android wear watch (Nixon Mission) the design doesn't work it isn't optimised for circular displays, won't sync with my phone and can't change from yards to meters. I really need a swim tracking app the foundation is there PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE try to fix this asap"
304,4,"The accompanying app on my Pebble Time tracks workouts pretty well, but too often, they just disappear when I attempt to sync (25-50% of the time).  I need to memorize the details after every swim just in case.  Very annoying."
305,1,"Doesn't work with Sony SmartWatch 3. The watch and the app connects fine, but then... Nothing. It registers a couple of meters, then just idles. The SmartWatch app is so fiddley and non-intuitive to use that it's best to keep away from it. Too bad it's a free app, otherwise I would definitely demand a refund!"
306,3,"Cannot select meters when starting a workout on my SWR50. Also, for some reason, lap detection didn't work - is there a specific setting that might block this (e.g. wrist gestures and location turned off)?"
307,2,Use this loads on my Pebble classic and it's great but recently bought the latest polar M600 android wear watch and it won't connect to the watch.  Such a shame
308,4,"Very useful to keep track of swim sessions and follow process. The smartwatch app however is sort of complicated,  needs getting used especially when selecting the pool,  pool length and restarting with the brakes while swimming"
309,2,Lacks Google Fit sync * Only syncs to watch when I tap watch picture * Ignores Material Design guidelines * Doesn't show calories * Support ignore all emails
310,1,I have a sony smart watch and I have tried 3 times in the pool to get it to track my swim but nothing????? Really frustrating as one of reasons bought watch üò†
311,5,Keeps tracks when I swim laps so I dont have to.  Syncs with my pebble watch. I know exactly how far Ive gone.
312,2,Most of the screen is cut off on my Nixon Mission (one of the few waterproof Android wear watches)
313,3,no work out upload by pebble2
314,5,I absolutely love this app!
315,5,Works great with garmin 920 xt
316,2,üò≠
317,5,Great program
318,5,Ok app
319,1,Use this with a Pebble Time. Stats are completely off. One lap I can do in 12 seconds and then the next in 43. Sometimes it captures my swims; sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it just stops tracking. Support was useless the first time I contacted them so why do I even bother. I feel I am just a beta tester who never gets an app update that really works.
320,2,"Does not automatically sync and no way to delete swims. So if you accidentally start the phone app, there is a 0m swim in your time line."
321,2,"I have lost a few swims...no indication that it was successful our crashed or intentionally deleted :)   I use a SW3, and it is VERY difficult to navigate after the swim...due to it being wet (duh), so a simpler and safe exit would be great, preferably using the physical button rather than relying on the touch screen, at least for the most common case."
322,4,Tried the app out with my sw3. Seems to work on but cant change the to pool length to yards.
323,5,Great app to track my lap swimming. It even syncs with devices like Garmin or Pebble
324,3,Not so good for p.time
325,1,"Awkward to use. Sometimes works and uploads but often crashes losing results on the device. Frequently fails to recognise a lap in the pool, especially in the first few laps. Suggest a calibration feature."
326,1,"I downloaded the app. It setup straight away on my pebble. I chose, ""sign up with Google"" And Huston we have a problem! First it asks me to now sign in manually. Then it tells me that's not my password. Umm ¬°¬°YES IT IS!! Then in ""reset password"" it tells me ""there's no account with that email"" then in new setup it tells me I ""can't use that address as an account already exists with that (#fffffing!!) email address"" :-[ And 'yards'!!! What is this the 1700s"
327,4,This app works well with my Garmin bioactive and Garmin connect.   I wish it was a bit more like strava with challenges
328,5,It's a great app to record your swimming distance. Very easy to use. Great to look at the weekly patterns
329,1,Stops tracking mid swim on the pebble time. This issue needs to be fixed.
330,3,When it syncs with my pebble it's fantastic.......It doesn't always syncüòê
331,1,"Buggy, won't sync with pebble and Nexus 5x"
332,1,I can't believe how excited I get when this app actually records the workout properly! I have never experienced such a buggy program. Too bad really
333,5,As new features added.. I can manually add my swim workout.. Love it.. No thanks to my sony smartwatch 3..failed after 6 months.. Sony water resist is such a failure.. Don waste ur money on Sony products üëé
334,5,"I love how well this app integrates with my Pebble classic.  Once in a while it will miss a 25, but 99% of the time it works great."
335,5,A must for pool swimmers. No open water features but still great.
336,5,Everything is working again.
337,2,"Using on Sony Smartwatch3 works OK but no way to exit App after workout, have to 'quit' the app and loose the data. Its glitchy with setting default pool length, seems to defaults to  yards instead of meters. I loaded my 'home' pool club details via the web and app but a week alter they are not showing as selectable. Contacted support a week ago and nothing heard - now returning the watch,  this App is useless without support."
338,1,I used this with my pebble Time .  I swam two sets today.  First set was 500m. It showed 400m. I swam 100 more and it only registered 25. Then I reset watch and swam 100 more and it showed I swam 25 again.  Ridiculous. I'll stick with my old swimovate poolmate.  I'd be interested if they updated and it actually worked because I like the app's breakdown of swim and many other functions. Very disappointing.
339,3,Just needs some bugs fixing... Unreliable to start workout... End up wasig a load of time trying to get it to start and again at the end of the work out... Pause/stop not working so have to quit out of the app and then lose all record of the workout....
340,2,Uploading has not been possible in the last week. No responses from pebble as to the problem. Support is not always as strong as one might want. Emailing Pebble  seems to be next to useless. When it works it's fine when it doesn't it's frustrating
341,1,"Since two last updates, pebble disconnects when I start the app in my phone. In the pool, it stars measuring distance then stops. Just buggy!"
342,5,"Awesome app, have been using for about 3/4 weeks with my Sony Smartwatch. Other than a couple of swims where the app crashed it's tracked all my swims pretty much floorlessly.  Occasionally picks wrong stroke, but that's like 1 in a 100+ lengths, and could be down to me!!"
343,4,"great app, have been using with Sony Smartwatch 3. Would be great if you could use heart rate with it? Also, would be good to sync with trainingpeaks?"
344,2,Worked for a while but now doesn't log anything. Seems to just reset or switch off after being put into theatre mode -  on Sony Smartwatch 3.
345,5,In the past I was having connection problems that rendered the app almost useless. At the moment my pebble time steel is working great. Auto rest detection is also a welcome addition and saves me from touching the pebble underwater (more healthy for watch electronics)
346,4,I have now got the app to work on Sony Smartwatch 3 (have to set screen to always on) Sync now working by forcing to do manually. No response from developer to questions although now not required as worked it out my self!
347,1,"Very dissatisfied out of the last five swims three have been lost or uploaded with errors and two have the incorrect length for example a swim of one hour comprised of 1300 meters the app saved it as 25 meters as it switched it self off not saving the  data, on several occasions it doesn't even log a length, very disappointing :-("
348,1,This app takes a LONG time to load and it feels it was developed in 2007. It really sucks. Not unstalling it because it doesn't have any competitor.
349,4,"I'm finding I'm much more motivated to swim, for about 6 months now. Excited to be closing on on my 100k mark since starting tracking."
350,4,Works better with Pebble time steel.  Still needs improvements in syncing workouts.
351,1,Timed out after my 11th lap. What's the point of having the app if I have to stop every lap to press the button.
352,2,"Sync is terrible, not sure it's accurate either.  Great idea, but this app is poorly supported."
353,5,"Improved app, improved watch app, connectivity issues seem to be resolved with the Pebble."
354,1,Stopped working as it used to
355,5,Use this app at least 3 times per week with my Sony Smartwatch. I have noticed a small bug with the latest version were its reporting the date as being a incorrect format.  I'm sure it will get fixed with a update.. :)
356,1,Another update. Same old upload issues. Should learn not to get my hopes up for this app.
357,5,It's so easy to use.   Sure a few improvements could be made to the interface and viewing but for a free app its outstanding.
358,3,"App is basic, could do with the manual mode that the website has. It's not much use if all I can do is look at what I've done."
359,1,App turns Bluetooth off and on every single time it is started.. WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? What if I listen to music via Bluetooth headphones and DON'T WANT TO TURN BLUETOOTH OFF???
360,1,It's unreliable
361,4,"Pretty good app and the only one I have found which works with a Sony Smartwatch 3 - the best smartwatch for athletics.   Slightly over-estimates the number of lengths you do, and some of the interactions take a bit of getting used to - took me about 3 goes to select my pool and set its length, and another 3 to work out how to stop the workout.    BUT - once you have learned how to use it, it does track your swimming pretty well, and looking at the reviews, it is in regular development so you can expect it to get better. Couple of feature requests:   Edit your swim to reduce the number of lengths you have swum (regularly adds 5-10%) Integration with Strava and Google fit  Thanks for the hard work all!"
362,1,"Firstly let me say that I really appreciate you developing this app.  However, V2 has some big issues.  1. The auto start/stop thing doesn't work. When turning after a length and pushing off, if you glide particularly straight and for too long the pebble thinks that you've stopped and shows that you are resting. This feature just does not work. Which is a shame.  2.You can't cycle between total time and current time for the current set.  3. What do the buttons do now? Complete mystery. Please roll it back."
363,4,Version 2 doesnt work at all. Please roll back. I started counting laps again and using a timer instead.... UPDATE: version 2.1 works like a charm. The manual procedure is the same of what we have before. Thanks for the prompt response.
364,1,"an awful mess. On my Pebble Time it just crashes. It was always inconsistent in counting the lengths, my backstroke messed up the count all the time, but now it won't even start anymore"
365,2,Sony Smart watch 3 doesn't accurately track lengths.  Keeping for now in hope fixed as would pay for working version.
366,1,It sets sync date as workout date.
367,2,"Had it crash twice in my last 2 swims where I lost my workout, using the Sony smartwatch 3. On that note, when trying to stop the workout it requires to exact of a movement sidewards to stop your workout and to many movements. Which means the time is not accurate, often takes 2 minutes before I get to stop the workout. Can we please just have one swipe upwards/downwards?  Update: Was done with the workout, tried to stop the workout, couldn't get it to swipe to the right. Then it crashed, workout lost...."
368,3,"The app on Pebble app took some figuring out but at least I saw it working and its potential. Afterwards though I could not sign in to the Android app nor the website. The website doesn't even come up for me, just a blank white screen. Couldn't sign up through Facebook either. The Android app kept telling me to check my data connection (which was fine.) I'd like to be able to upload my workouts but so far not so good. I submitted a ticket so we'll see how it goes."
369,1,"Edit: lost another workout. 1 star. The website's great.  The app is ok, but lacks the drill-down information available on the site. You're better off browsing the mobile version, and only using the app to upload data from a swim tracker, like a pebble.  Having said that, integration with a pebble is incredibly unreliable, with workouts regularly requiring multiple attempts to sync, or simply getting lost altogether."
370,2,"Based on 5 mths use, Using pebble & nexus6 Works adequately as a timer as long as you do length change intervals yourself (I found auto detection of end changes really unreliable), but even then most sessions it  sees at least one 50m length as 100m. Not great for accurately timing sessions.  The real problem is the synch with phone app. Workouts so often don't upload and that is a hugely frustrating and app-undermining problem that the team seem to have significant issues resolving over multiple releases."
371,3,"It's okay. Only thing keeping this at 3 stars is that it actually did track my laps. Apart from that, Can't change from yards to meters on a SmartWatch 3. Android watch interface is slow. Phone interface is super slow. Phone app doesn't provide much detail. Good MVP ,I would use again. please work to improve the UI significantly."
372,1,"I only got this to use with my pebble for logging swim times. Have tried it several times and not once has it managed to sync my swim and now the workouts seem to be lost. The pebble app itself is really good, but without being able to save it only half works. Pretty lame really."
373,2,I have tried and tried but it always tells me it has no new workouts.  Even when the watch has it right on screen.  Also: cut the constant complaint about missing data connections.
374,1,"Other than that, this app didn't do much of anything. Just swam a thousand with this on my pebble. It counted one lap. Not much point, then."
375,1,"I've just been for my first swim using my Sony Smartwatch 3, and nothing is syncing! It also showed on the watch that I'd done 500m when I'd only done 450."
376,2,Tried this with Sony sw3 seemed to work ok in the pool but phone app says no workouts
377,1,"Android wear - using Sony Smartwatch 3 ( I think the only one suitable for swimming) been 3 times, uploads fine but recording is massively out. Just swam 48 lengths of a 33.3m pool in 42 mins, breaststroke, with no breaks or pauses. App thinks I swam for 5 mins and rested for 37mins also only recorded 462m instead of 1584m. Gutted as a bought the watch to use this app, currently it's a complete waste of time. Hope it gets a solid update to make it more accurate."
378,1,"Nothing has changed despite numerous updates and reports that ""sync has finally been fixed"". V1.5 on Pebble shows exactly the same behaviour. New workouts do not sync."
379,1,"Galaxy's S5 and Pebble time. Worked for a while. Now (with updates) useless. Always get error message to ""check phone data connection"". Huh?"
380,2,"Was working fine with pebble, but recently can't upload any swims. The pebble app itself works fine in the pool though."
381,1,"It says I need to check my phones data connection, but I have a perfectly usable WiFi signal."
382,2,Please check data connection but in on wifi and mobile data.
383,1,"Keeps showing a pop-up that says ""please check your phone's data connection"" even though I'm connected to WiFi! Wanted to use with my Pebble but that's obviously not going to work until this gets fixed. Please help!"
384,1,"Was signing up but it is stuck at Step 5. Keeps loading and loading and loading, and now is still loading. After that, I kill the app and login again. I have to login again every time I launch the app. Uninstall."
385,5,Update 1.9 enabled Pebble Time to work
386,1,The whole reason I bought the pebble time was to record swimming work outs... Needless to say the app doesn't work with the time and is a complete hassle and waste to try and get it to connect.
387,1,After a long and annoying setup process the app failed to record my workout
388,1,Can't even say what it is like because despite advertising pebble time support it can't connect to it as it doesn't even recognise that the pebble time uses a different pebble app on your phone from a normal pebble. A really obvious error that bodes poorly for the quality of the software as a whole.
389,1,"Work with Pebble. Says it does, but the workouts don't upload."
390,1,Keeps saying to check data connection even on wifi. Couldnt connect to pebble time.
391,1,"Look like a great app, unfortunately it doesn't recognize my Pebble Time."
392,1,As title
393,1,"Trying to upload any workouts from a pebble has never worked and seemingly never will. I have come to the conclusion that the release of this app was nothing more than an elaborate joke, don't waste your time with it."
394,2,The app is a good idea. Unfortunately it frustrates me that when I swim it tracks my distance up to 550m and then thats it. It will not track further than that when I'm swimming 1600m. There has not been a time where it completely tracked my whole swim. Everytime I see an update I try the app again and I get disappointed. Thats the reason I bought the watch and got the app. I'm hoping it will get fix VER SOON!
395,3,"I understand that the uploads are the fault of Pebble and not this app, but the issue of not being able to sign in while my phone is connected to WiFi is a problem with this app. To successfully sign in, I need to be connected to a mobile network."
396,1,Forces you to create a new account but at Step 1 the app will not show any of the public pools near our location - totally useless. Guessing the only reason it has been added to the Play Store is so they can sell email addresses to SPAM services
397,1,Does not sync with pebble.  Does not track swimming.  Pebble app stops keeping track after 500y worthless.
398,1,Will not allow me to log in. Pretty worthless.
399,2,Edit : Pebble sync still doesn't work after app update. Tried on multiple devices. Failed every single time.              The sync just doesn't work. Proper testing isn't done before releasing the app. Disappointed me. Was the primary reason to buying the pebble watch.
400,5,"I had lots of problems with the standalone Pebble uploader, but the new integrated uploader has worked first time for me for my two workouts since switching from the standalone uploader."
401,2,"Like the other commenters, I have also experienced issues with uploading. But even once workouts are uploaded, it's not that valuable. There are no workout breakdowns (pace, etc per length/50/100), or at least they are impossible to find. The user interface is challenging to navigate. The social aspect has possibilities but it suffers currently from lack of user base. I will keep using the app but it will take some new features before it's something I love."
402,2,"it worked consistently.  I bought the Pebble and got this app for swimming.  Unfortunately, the data transfer from the Pebble to the app (this one and the uploader app) fails to work more than it does work.  Feedback in the pool is limited, but would be acceptable if I could actually get the workouts uploaded after to review the rest of the information.  If you guys don't get this working consistently quickly you will lose all credibility and it will allow someone to come in with something that does work."
403,1,"The app will work, it would track my swim on every lap and then the next time I go to swim, it will stop tracking. It will go as far as 125 meters then stop when I'm at my 400 meter mark. It's very aggravating and I'm at the point of getting rid of my peeble and this app."
404,1,"Polar m600 is an Android watch. However, this app does not work with Polar. Too bad!  I like the idea of a locked screen and hope this can be fixed in the future."
405,1,On my pebble steel I get a message to check my data connection. There's nothing wrong with my data connection. Firmware 2.9.1
406,5,Works great
407,5,Nice
408,5,Useful
409,5,Best
410,1,Code brown
411,5,I like it
