0,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple’s UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the “X” should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).

Lastly, this has a very social media feel to it in some places, especially as I was going through the privacy settings, so if that isn’t your thing (like it isn’t for me), make sure you turn your profile to private.",0.8629925
1,track your swims and achieve your goals,"This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I’m part of a club team and we have “wall tap counters” (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you’re on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",0.8629925
2,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I want to like this app. It has potential, and I’ve stuck with it for the past three years. Unfortunately, the bugs are overwhelming. Even something as simple as drill mode, where the app doesn’t need to do anything except what it is told by the user, fails to record proper distance and time. Not to mention the latest “upgrade” to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn’t work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What’s more, half of the time the workouts don’t upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features. Make the app solid and reliable first, then focus on upgrades.",0.8629925
3,track your swims and achieve your goals,"The new iPhone app format update is the worst user interface I've ever seen. Lots of wasted space with useless bar graphs and useless lifetime totals, difficult to see your last workout data, and hard to read it when you find it. And a new focus on offering workouts but if you don't need them you're going to have to constantly navigate around that. The Apple watch workout app shows the real data a million times better. Hopefully they'll fix it because their Apple watch app is better than the workout one. 

Lastly, still useful from an old review:
There are no weekly totals, no analysis of improvement. If they improve all this stuff it could be useful.",0.5215067
4,track your swims and achieve your goals,This app is great when it works. Just after the new iOS update the app has been buggy and lost two of my swims. I️ like that it handles rest between intervals and sets. I️ also like to set the drill mode. The Apple Watch workout app tracks in the background and it adds to your rings.  Ending a workout can be a pain since the way the Apple Watch and app are relying on pressure. Did a 4000 yard workout with my masters group and the app locked up and lost the workout. It needs serious fixes and an update. May go back to apples fitness app which is harder to handle I️. The water for drill sets.,0.50521666
5,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I haven’t even gotten around to using this app in the pool because the interface/settings are extremely cumbersome. This app won’t save your preferences on workout searches; it defaults back to the preferences you input when you set up your account. I made the “mistake” of setting up preferences that turned out to be very restrictive and only showed one workout. If I want to search for a new workout, I have to change my preferences every time I navigate away from the Workouts tab. If I favorite a workout after fiddling with my preferences for the umpteenth time, I have to change my settings yet again when I want to view those workouts.",0.8629925
6,track your swims and achieve your goals,I’ve used this App for 4 years and over the last year it has been crashing and dropping my swims halfway through my 3500 yard sessions. I regularly have to check and manually add 1300+ yard sets to accurately track my total distance. I submitted a report and they told me it was because I’m not running the current version (which I am on an Apple Series 6). Unfortunately this is the best tracker I have found so far so I deal with the crashes that have become a regular part of my training.,0.50521666
7,track your swims and achieve your goals,I like the app on the Apple watch 2 but doesn’t translate well to iPhone. The workouts usually take days to sync and the calories always show 0 even though my watch obviously picks up the movement. It just doesn’t equate to the same number of calories as the resistance brings when the watch knows that your swimming. Not sure I explained well but it’s frustrating. The only thing I like about his app is that it differentiates resting vs swimming time. Haven’t found another swimming app that does that automatically.,0.50521666
8,track your swims and achieve your goals,When it automatically syncs it is good but each year have problems with this. I love when it works correctly but not so much when it doesn’t.

9,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I have used this app with my Series 2 Watch, and it worked well. The user interface is great, and accounting for kick drills is excellent. 

It needs an update however for the new Watch iOS. I don’t blame the developer, but it needs to be addressed. Blows away Apple’s swim
tracker, when it works.

UPDATE:

I have uninstalled and then reinstalled. Still doesn’t work on Apple Watch Series 3. Developer is VERY responsive, which is appreciated, but still not working. Hopefully soon because it is an excellent app, when it works.

FINAL UPDATE:

I have done everything short of sacrificing a goat to get this app to work. I even reset my Apple Watch Series 3 to factory settings. After 200 meters, watch read 50.

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin.

109,track your swims and achieve your goals,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",0.8629925
110,track your swims and achieve your goals,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing.

123,track your swims and achieve your goals,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",0.8629925

So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",0.20037936

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin.

462,discover and create smart workouts,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",0.20037936
463,discover and create smart workouts,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours.

476,discover and create smart workouts,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",0.20037936

706,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple’s UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the “X” should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).

707,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I’m part of a club team and we have “wall tap counters” (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you’re on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",0.99453956

Not to mention the latest “upgrade” to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn’t work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What’s more, half of the time the workouts don’t upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features.

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin.

815,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",0.99453956
816,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work.

I really wanted to use this app for my pool swimming.,0.11637638
828,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),I want to use this app. I love swim.com and use it to track workouts.

829,analyze every part of your swim(distance time pace SWOLF strokes),"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",0.99453956

Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing.

So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",0.9735154

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin.

1168,connect with other swimmers,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",0.9735154

I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well.

1182,connect with other swimmers,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",0.9735154

1412,compete with swimmers,"Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple’s UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the “X” should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).

1413,compete with swimmers,"This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I’m part of a club team and we have “wall tap counters” (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you’re on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",0.9523326

Not to mention the latest “upgrade” to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn’t work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What’s more, half of the time the workouts don’t upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features.

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration.

1521,compete with swimmers,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",0.9523326
1522,compete with swimmers,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well.

1535,compete with swimmers,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",0.9523326

So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",0.9359017

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin.

1874,view performace over time,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",0.9359017
1875,view performace over time,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work.

1888,view performace over time,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",0.9359017

Which is a shame.  2.You can't cycle between total time and current time for the current set.  3. What do the buttons do now? Complete mystery. Please roll it back.",0.40736675

On that note, when trying to stop the workout it requires to exact of a movement sidewards to stop your workout and to many movements. Which means the time is not accurate, often takes 2 minutes before I get to stop the workout. Can we please just have one swipe upwards/downwards?

2083,view performace over time,"Based on 5 mths use, Using pebble & nexus6 Works adequately as a timer as long as you do length change intervals yourself (I found auto detection of end changes really unreliable), but even then most sessions it  sees at least one 50m length as 100m. Not great for accurately timing sessions.  The real problem is the synch with phone app. Workouts so often don't upload and that is a hugely frustrating and app-undermining problem that the team seem to have significant issues resolving over multiple releases.",0.9359017
