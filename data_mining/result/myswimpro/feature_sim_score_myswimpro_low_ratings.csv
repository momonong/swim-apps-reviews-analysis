0,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.97784686
1,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.24219874
2,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.24219874
3,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  
Please respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.  Remember if it’s not broken why do u have to mess with it!",0.24219874
4,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.24219874
5,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.97022665
6,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",0.97516733
7,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.24219874
8,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.24219874
9,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.24219874
10,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.24219874
11,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.24219874
12,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.24219874
13,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.24219874
14,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",0.24219874
15,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.",0.97022665
16,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I went to the pool today and planned on using my watch and Swim Pro! Nope, I was greeted with tiny print telling me, nah, this app requires me to get permission! I’m sitting with my legs in the water and ready to start laps and no the app is NOT going to track my laps. And it didn’t. Useless! I paid for an app for swimming and it refused to work. If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry. I pay to swim and paid for an app. Useless!
I have been to the pool 3 times with this app. Nothing works. Garbage. 
There needs to be instructions on setting it up and using it. Instead, it wants to sell upgrades. I hate it!",0.24219874
17,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"When I signed up and filled in my profile info there was a workout.  Paid my subscription fee and went to pool. When I opened app there was a confusing amount of info and the workout included dryland etc. My profile did not include dryland, and it did include my available workout time.   The workout I saw before subscription was good. After I paid … totally different and I’m not able to stop and fiddle on my phone in the bright sun.  I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.  Very disappointed and wishing I didn’t spend money on this nonsense.",0.24219874
18,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Used the app with my Garmin Fenix 5S pro today for the first time. Already seeing the bugs that previous reviewers have mentioned. Even though my settings across Garmin, this app, and my watch are all set to yards and miles, it kept switching back-and-forth between meters and yards and then it was short changing me on the yards. It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash. I like the idea of workouts but this is going to drive me nuts and not sure I’m willing to pay for something that doesn’t work properly.",0.999044
19,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.,0.24219874
20,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

tl;dr. this app is only for swimmers who are primarily concerned with lap times and who don’t have a team and are willing to pay for a pretty expensive app.",0.24219874
21,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m done with this app. Don’t get me wrong this app is great and I’ve loved using it as I’ve gotten back into swimming. However somehow I got logged out of my account and couldn’t remember the password I used when I first set up the app. I’ve requested several password resets over the course of a week and have not received one in my inbox, spam, or junk folders. I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.",0.24219874
22,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"First off I’m just starting off swimming and have used the app once with my watch and it seems to have done what I was hoping it would do.  I’m not a sophisticated swimmer so I can’t comment on all the analytics etc. 

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. 

Well you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.",0.24219874
23,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Meh. It’s ok. Downloaded it for the drill/kick set mode. That part is fine. I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements). Lots of great potential here but a lot to be desired…maybe in time it’ll improve. At least I didn’t spend money on it.",0.24219874
24,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Recently got a series 3 AppleWatch and was looking for a good swim workout app. Most of the reviews were positive for MSP so I thought I’d give it a shot. Prior to the recent update it was great, I’m not a pro swimmer so the basic features do just fine. Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming. I cleared the cache on my phone & watch, restarted the watch and it still doesn’t work right. I would have given it a higher mark because I like the app but it is now broken & virtually unusable to me...",0.24219874
25,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.24219874
26,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.9749959

I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.24219874

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

29,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

It was very upsetting for me that EVERYTHING, from technique videos to training plans, all required payment to continue. As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee.

After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.  I suggest you create an option where the user can only customize their workouts and log their workouts. All the other stuff on there I don’t even look at.,0.24219874
38,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. 

This behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. 

It’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.",0.24219874
39,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I found the description to be a bit misleading for a free app. Yes the app is free but there is nothing you can do with out the paid subscription. I’m training for a triathlon and wanted a good resource to help with swimming workouts but the 7 day trial isn’t a long enough evaluation period for me to see if I want to spend $20/month on an subscription. I can track swimming on my Apple Watch so I don’t need the app without the premium features at all.  I thought that was a too costly considering I can’t tell what I would really be getting since everything is locked down. No thanks.,0.24219874

41,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Been using for years and used to like it a lot. I understand the developers have to make money, but these days it’s quite annoying to use this app if you don’t need any to sign up for one of their paid subscriptions.

If you want to use this app as your coach it’s probably a good one. But if you just want to track your swimming activity, there are probably better options now.",0.24219874
42,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,Having to unlock the watch just to switch the reps is very difficult because there is water on the watch and that messes with the screen heavily. Only way it’s possible is to dry your hands and the watch every time. My suggest is being able to double click the crown button or side button to switch reps.

43,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

* Initially Garmin sync would reset itself every time I entered “Account Settings”. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get that working as expected.

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout.

156,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.24219874

215,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9729326

277,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.99923617
278,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.32248434
279,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.24219874
280,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.24219874

282,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

555,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.25573066
556,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.9748269
557,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9748269
558,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  
Please respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.  Remember if it’s not broken why do u have to mess with it!",0.9748269
559,Personalized swim Training Plans,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.9748269
560,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.22296308
561,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",0.24368495
562,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.9748269
563,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.9748269
564,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.9748269
565,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.9748269
566,Personalized swim Training Plans,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.9748269
567,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.9748269
568,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.9748269
569,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",0.9748269
570,Personalized swim Training Plans,"For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.",0.22296308

If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry. I pay to swim and paid for an app. Useless!

The workout I saw before subscription was good. After I paid … totally different and I’m not able to stop and fiddle on my phone in the bright sun.  I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.

Even though my settings across Garmin, this app, and my watch are all set to yards and miles, it kept switching back-and-forth between meters and yards and then it was short changing me on the yards. It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash.

The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.,0.9748269
575,Personalized swim Training Plans,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.",0.9748269

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription.

Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress).

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.9748269

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.24293533

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.9748269

It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

602,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I love all the features of this app and it truly is top notch. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is unreasonably high. I understand the amount of work and the excellence that went into this, but it doesn’t serve people who need an app like this that is reasonably affordable. I already pay a gym membership premium.

603,Personalized swim Training Plans,The workouts are not challenging or tailored to my performance—annoying since the app has spent nearly 2 years collecting my data. The videos and various workouts can all be found (better) on the internet. Hardly worth $119. You’ll also receive all sorts of emails and “training” videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they’re in a partnership with—like a $200 device to build lung capacity.

After downloading the app to my phone and registering, I tried to open the app on my watch. It didn’t recognize that I had registered on my phone and wouldn’t move past the login screen. I had to restart my watch for it to log in. 

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. 

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout.

711,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9748269

770,Personalized swim Training Plans,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.23409507
771,Personalized swim Training Plans,"When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything. I love using this app as it tracks my swimming but, the update has made it stressful and annoying.",0.7819582

Also some bugs in editing swims. No matter what I edit. It saves the default program unless it is custom from the ground up.

775,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I have high hopes for this app.  Would love to see the option to input my 100yd base interval.

776,Personalized swim Training Plans,"If I could rate the app for the watch part probably a solid 3.5 stars 4 when you factory in the possibilities under future updates.

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

831,Personalized swim Training Plans,App is just waste of time and money.,0.9915726
832,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.417232
833,Personalized swim Training Plans,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9900574
834,Personalized swim Training Plans,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9748269
835,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9748269
836,Personalized swim Training Plans,would most likely be a good app except for the fact that you can't do anything without a subscription im 14 years old and don't have $179.99 to spen in an app all i need to use is the dryland again seems like a really good app and has really good customer service but it's not for me (sorry if i offended anyone with this review),0.9774879
837,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.41314673
838,Personalized swim Training Plans,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall.

874,Personalized swim Training Plans,There is almost no information on the swim session. A simple workout in fitbit records so much more information. I'm very disappointed with the app. And they expect almost 200€ per year. Total waste of money.,0.97917956

876,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Swim workouts seem legit, however no real guidance to do the test workouts to get the dynamic pacing in place. Analysis is extra, 50, 100 or 150 bucks... But no explanation what that entails. No coach profiles to see what their credentials are. The Garmin IQ app integration is worthless, doesn't work at all.

MySwimPro Garmin Connect IQ & Android App. I must say, that MySwimPro works much-much better than other ones (including measuring and convenience to use in pool almost w/o necessity to look at watch every couple minutes). Still, Can developer explain the critical issues below (which prevent me to use App): 1. Activities cannot be deleted from Feeds item screen (activity's context menu item ""Delete"" does nothing) neither from Profile screen (no ""Delete"" option at all), if you have wrong or test activities - that garbage left forever. 2. Parameter Settings->Workouts->RestTimeBetweenSets does not work, if you point 10 secs, 15 secs, etc. - on watch side (Garmin F6XP) the MySwimPro app ALWAYS countdowns 30 secs between Sets and 60 secs between Groups. 3. After Workout ended, saved and watch synced (App option ""Garmin pair & authorized sync"" are turned on) - App's Activities had not shown in my Feeds/Profile until I re-installed App. 4. Watch App (Garmin) does not vibrate a watch device while you are out of / back to HR Zone described for Sets.",0.22296308

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

1110,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.14602455
1111,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.993645
1112,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.993645

1114,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.993645

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

1117,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.993645
1118,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.993645

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.993645

Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.993645
1121,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

1124,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

1266,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.993645

1325,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.12391349

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.3129928
1388,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year",VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9995772
1389,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.993645
1390,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.993645

1392,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.3087247

The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

1665,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.18244605
1666,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.9888124
1667,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9888124
1668,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  
Please respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.  Remember if it’s not broken why do u have to mess with it!",0.9888124
1669,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.9888124
1670,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.14916451
1671,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",0.17020115
1672,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.9888124
1673,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.9888124
1674,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.9888124
1675,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.9888124
1676,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.9888124
1677,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.9888124
1678,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.9888124
1679,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",0.9888124
1680,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.",0.14916451

Nope, I was greeted with tiny print telling me, nah, this app requires me to get permission! I’m sitting with my legs in the water and ready to start laps and no the app is NOT going to track my laps. And it didn’t. Useless! I paid for an app for swimming and it refused to work. If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry. I pay to swim and paid for an app. Useless!

It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash.

The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.,0.9888124
1685,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.",0.9888124

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription.

I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.16943952

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.9888124

It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

It was very upsetting for me that EVERYTHING, from technique videos to training plans, all required payment to continue. As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee.

1702,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,I got this app so I can customize my workouts and swim at my own pace. After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required.

1703,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

1821,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9888124

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app.

1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.16046125

1942,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.34784132
1943,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.99782264
1944,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9888124
1945,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9888124

1947,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.13534908

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9948009

You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

2251,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.9948009

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

It was very upsetting for me that EVERYTHING, from technique videos to training plans, all required payment to continue. As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee.

After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.

I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

2376,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9948009

2435,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.11320681

Also some bugs in editing swims. No matter what I edit. It saves the default program unless it is custom from the ground up.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

2499,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc...

2500,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9948009
2501,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",would most likely be a good app except for the fact that you can't do anything without a subscription im 14 years old and don't have $179.99 to spen in an app all i need to use is the dryland again seems like a really good app and has really good customer service but it's not for me (sorry if i offended anyone with this review),0.995975
2502,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.2984509

2775,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.6924064

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

2779,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.

Even though my settings across Garmin, this app, and my watch are all set to yards and miles, it kept switching back-and-forth between meters and yards and then it was short changing me on the yards. It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash. I like the idea of workouts but this is going to drive me nuts and not sure I’m willing to pay for something that doesn’t work properly.",0.8027963
2794,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.,0.74446136
2795,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

However somehow I got logged out of my account and couldn’t remember the password I used when I first set up the app. I’ve requested several password resets over the course of a week and have not received one in my inbox, spam, or junk folders. I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription.

Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.74446136

Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.68281317

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.74446136

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

2806,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

2931,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.74446136

2990,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.67613435

3052,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.8055558
3053,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.79768646
3054,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.74446136
3055,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.74446136

3057,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.80288696

Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

3330,Build your own custom workouts,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.14811446
3331,Build your own custom workouts,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.993405
3332,Build your own custom workouts,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.993405

3334,Build your own custom workouts,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.993405

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.1146583
3336,Build your own custom workouts,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

3337,Build your own custom workouts,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.993405

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.993405

Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.993405
3341,Build your own custom workouts,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market.

3344,Build your own custom workouts,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

3486,Build your own custom workouts,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.993405

3545,Build your own custom workouts,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.1260098

3607,Build your own custom workouts,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.31499884
3608,Build your own custom workouts,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9995136
3609,Build your own custom workouts,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.993405
3610,Build your own custom workouts,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.993405

3612,Build your own custom workouts,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.31073368

I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced.

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

3885,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.6707194

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.76392156
3887,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.76392156

3889,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself.

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change.

3891,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

3892,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.76392156
3893,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.76392156

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.76392156
3895,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.76392156
3896,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

3899,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

4041,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.76392156

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.6540019
4101,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use.

This does with some videos and other training sundries. Unfortunately 80% of the app is behind a subscribe monthly wall which is far outside my appetite.

Also some bugs in editing swims. No matter what I edit. It saves the default program unless it is custom from the ground up. 

Good stats screen and glad to see something enter the arena but the pricing model will eventually push me away.",0.76392156

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.7876418
4163,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data",VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.815209
4164,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.76392156
4165,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.76392156

4167,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.7848671

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

4440,Drill & technique video library,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.30134785
4441,Drill & technique video library,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.96313995

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.96313995

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.26900086
4446,Drill & technique video library,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

4447,Drill & technique video library,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.96313995
4448,Drill & technique video library,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.96313995
4450,Drill & technique video library,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.96313995
4451,Drill & technique video library,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.96313995
4452,Drill & technique video library,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.96313995

All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.96313995
4454,Drill & technique video library,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",0.96313995
4455,Drill & technique video library,"For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

* Initially Garmin sync would reset itself every time I entered “Account Settings”. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get that working as expected.

It’s a real pity as pool swimming can be quite monotonous without a coaching aspect.",0.96313995

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. 

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout.

4596,Drill & technique video library,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.96313995

4655,Drill & technique video library,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

4717,Drill & technique video library,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.45991537
4718,Drill & technique video library,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9822613
4719,Drill & technique video library,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.96313995
4720,Drill & technique video library,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.96313995

4722,Drill & technique video library,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.45592326

It has a lot of bad reviews and look that this company is not interested in fixing its issues. Also the company take time to reply reviews to explain the issue blaming Garmin of its poor behavior. My reply for this is very direct. MySwimPro if you don't have a a ready Production App do not put that in the market or allows Garmin to set that in its app store you are misleading clients like me of getting into an expensive subscription that does not work. and where the first response that you have as a company is to delegate the responsibility of you poor quality and control to other like Garmin,0.86804825

I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.3352338

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.95291054

4999,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

5001,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.95291054
5003,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.95291054
5004,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.95291054
5005,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.95291054
5006,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.95291054
5007,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.95291054

All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.95291054
5009,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",0.95291054

But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry.

It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription.

Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.32275674

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.95291054

It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

5151,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.95291054

5210,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.31412765

5272,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.4913572
5273,Compete in monthly swim challenges,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9749319
5274,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.95291054
5275,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.95291054
5276,Compete in monthly swim challenges,would most likely be a good app except for the fact that you can't do anything without a subscription im 14 years old and don't have $179.99 to spen in an app all i need to use is the dryland again seems like a really good app and has really good customer service but it's not for me (sorry if i offended anyone with this review),0.9565578
5277,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.48744115
5278,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall.

Still, Can developer explain the critical issues below (which prevent me to use App): 1. Activities cannot be deleted from Feeds item screen (activity's context menu item ""Delete"" does nothing) neither from Profile screen (no ""Delete"" option at all), if you have wrong or test activities - that garbage left forever. 2. Parameter Settings->Workouts->RestTimeBetweenSets does not work, if you point 10 secs, 15 secs, etc. - on watch side (Garmin F6XP) the MySwimPro app ALWAYS countdowns 30 secs between Sets and 60 secs between Groups. 3. After Workout ended, saved and watch synced (App option ""Garmin pair & authorized sync"" are turned on) - App's Activities had not shown in my Feeds/Profile until I re-installed App. 4.

I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

5550,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.30764127

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.9613416
5552,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9613416

5554,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.9613416

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.27535856
5556,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

5557,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.9613416
5558,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

5560,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.9613416
5561,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

5564,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

5706,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9613416

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.28633294

5827,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.4657722
5828,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.98100096
5829,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9613416
5830,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9613416

5832,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.46179378
5833,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them.

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

6105,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.55265844

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.8515821

However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.8515821

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).

6261,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.8515821

6320,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.5339242

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.6869944
6383,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.8924367
6384,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.8515821
6385,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.8515821

6387,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

6660,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.29681933

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened).

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).

6816,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9644057

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.45569614
6938,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9831402
6939,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9644057
6940,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9644057

6942,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it.

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

7215,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.83858883

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).

7371,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.57275194

7430,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.9193722
7493,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.63929456
7494,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.57275194
7495,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.57275194

7497,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9175964
7498,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall. I can build it but anytime I try to save it it is asking me to upgrade and won’t save it.  Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don’t need nor want the coaching help. I just want an app that I can create/save/log workouts,0.57275194

7743,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I think it's a good idea, decent app. I  believe it's too expensive to see the trainings tho! 100$ a year is too much. Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.   I'd suggest asking for times or usual swimming trainings and then the app could actually suggest times/distances according to that? Now that I'd pay for.",0.8924508

Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9927826

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.15336019

7774,Track total distance swum,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.15336019

You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

7781,Track total distance swum,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

7784,Track total distance swum,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.9911114

I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.15336019

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

7926,Track total distance swum,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.15336019

7985,Track total distance swum,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9898593

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.9986702
8048,Track total distance swum,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.2354575
8049,Track total distance swum,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.15336019
8050,Track total distance swum,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.15336019

8052,Track total distance swum,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.99889165
8053,Track total distance swum,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall. I can build it but anytime I try to save it it is asking me to upgrade and won’t save it.  Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don’t need nor want the coaching help. I just want an app that I can create/save/log workouts,0.15336019

I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.18467736

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

8481,View logged workouts on your profile,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.98847127

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.1627013

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.34996858
8603,View logged workouts on your profile,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.99767035
8604,View logged workouts on your profile,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.98847127
8605,View logged workouts on your profile,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.98847127

8607,View logged workouts on your profile,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

8880,Earn achievement badges,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.7305647

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

9036,Earn achievement badges,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.70710677

9095,Earn achievement badges,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

9157,Earn achievement badges,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.8365428
9158,Earn achievement badges,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.763761
9159,Earn achievement badges,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.70710677
9160,Earn achievement badges,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.70710677

9162,Earn achievement badges,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it.

I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.7305647

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.70710677

9439,Follow friends,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

9441,Follow friends,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.70710677

You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

9591,Follow friends,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.70710677

9650,Follow friends,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.7151459

9712,Follow friends,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.8365428
9713,Follow friends,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.763761
9714,Follow friends,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.70710677
9715,Follow friends,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.70710677

9717,Follow friends,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.8340739

Still, Can developer explain the critical issues below (which prevent me to use App): 1. Activities cannot be deleted from Feeds item screen (activity's context menu item ""Delete"" does nothing) neither from Profile screen (no ""Delete"" option at all), if you have wrong or test activities - that garbage left forever. 2. Parameter Settings->Workouts->RestTimeBetweenSets does not work, if you point 10 secs, 15 secs, etc. - on watch side (Garmin F6XP) the MySwimPro app ALWAYS countdowns 30 secs between Sets and 60 secs between Groups. 3. After Workout ended, saved and watch synced (App option ""Garmin pair & authorized sync"" are turned on) - App's Activities had not shown in my Feeds/Profile until I re-installed App. 4.

9959,Follow friends,"Don't advertise yourself as free in the app store if you are not free. For those who are reading this the app is $7.99 a month.  The app doesn't tell you until you create an account and custom your profile.  It's a huge waste of time. You do all this only for it to tell you... Now the next step is to select what kind of membership you want.  The cheapest option is $7.99 a month.  NO PHONE APP SHOULD COST THAT MUCH!  Responding to your comment: HA! That's a scam if I ever saw one.  I'm willing to bet your ""free trial"" required a credit card... And that it's next to impossible to end, thus, you end up getting charged. Does that sound about right.",0.70710677

9963,Follow friends,"I think it's a good idea, decent app. I  believe it's too expensive to see the trainings tho! 100$ a year is too much. Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.   I'd suggest asking for times or usual swimming trainings and then the app could actually suggest times/distances according to that? Now that I'd pay for.",0.79994863

9967,Follow friends,"I also would like a weight tracker with graph, km or Miles and to modify the time it takes to swim a workout. No beginner can swim that fast, even a former competitive swimmer like me. It would also be nice to log other types of workouts like yoga etc. Pros: the videos I watched were pretty good, not always the right video in the right place. Easy to use and learn. Like the custom workout feature. Give it a try but be prepared it may cost you for the features you want.",0.70710677

9970,Follow friends,Why ask people to pay for membership for this king of features? Everyone would much prefer a single in app purchase to unlock the pro version of this app. It's a shame because the app itself is great.,0.7203772
9971,Follow friends,"It has great potential. I like the training videos, there needs to be more of these. I'm not sure what 'descend 1-4' etc means, or 'just make'? You should also be able to select a workout based solely on strokes, distance or time, as sometimes you're time or stroke restricted. Breaststroke hurts my knee, so an option to auto design a workout based on stroke preference would be good. I like other users idea of a user database. It would definitely extend the usability of this app 10 fold.",0.70710677
