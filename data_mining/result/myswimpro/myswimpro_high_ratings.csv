0,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",4,My Swim Pro Review
1,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",5,Great investment
2,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",5,From Analytics to Coaching
3,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",5,You can’t believe all that’s packed into this subscription.
4,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",4,Great but not fail safe
6,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",5,Great for Pool and Open Water
7,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",5,"Seriously, Best Swim App Available"
8,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",5,"Very useful, but a few issues"
10,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",5,"Love, love, love this app!"
12,"I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.",5,"Great Swimming App, BUT had to uninstall/reinstall after latest update"
14,"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it. 

I can’t wait to see what goals I hit from now til winter! And I love that you can use GPS for free open water swim or put in how long your pool is. I also can’t wait to do this at the beach!",5,I use this with my Apple Watch Series 6
15,"I am at 67 a new swimmer . I cannot begin to explain the benefit that this app and the outstanding customer support has bestowed to me. I started out needing to rest after 25 meters . Going to the pool to swim was a source of anxiety and I went because I knew it was in my best interest. Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training . You want to just swim go ahead and enjoy but if you want to improve and become engaged in a fun healthy sport ? Stop wasting your time sign up and join all of us at MySeimPro community . Go ahead , I dare you !",5,Simply amazing
16,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",5,Can't say enough great things about this app!
20,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",4,Great app in need of a few tweaks
21,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",5,SPECTACULAR APP!!
23,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",4,It’s great now
25,"This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved. 

I recently had an issue with my account and the customer service was on point. I got an immediate response and my issue was resolved with that one response. Keep up the great work, MySwimPro!",5,Awesome app. Wonderful customer service
28,"I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",5,Great app
29,"While the app itself is amazing between the video demos, training options, workouts, and tracking available, the customer service is what has made me come and place this review. I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",5,Great customer support
30,"This app is amazing and the customer service is awesome! I had been a swimmer growing up and always had access to a coach. But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming. I’ve lost more weight than I thought I could, I’m swimming faster now than when I was a kid and I feel like I’m apart of a community. This app really changed my life for the better.",5,Lost 20 pounds already- life changing
32,"I really do like this app. I love that it gives analytics on distance per stroke. I wear an Apple
Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",4,Like not love
33,"Live the app! The best part I enjoy are all the videos and how exercises are explained throughly. There are lots of exercises in workouts and videos to explain before activities, and you can change during workouts. 

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",5,Review
35,"I am in my late 50s, was a swimmer in HS and college and really came back to the sport because I needed low impact on my knees. I have loved this app for almost 3 yrs. 
I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim. 
Go MSP Team!",5,What a way to come through in this time of pool closures!
40,"I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",4,Really Awesome App But Needs Small Improvements
43,"This isn’t really a critique it’s more me asking if a feature could be added. I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well. 

Thank you.",5,Paddling Feature Request
44,Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid. Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.,5,Getting back in water from being out for 2 years
46,"I began training and racing in triathlons last year. Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.",5,Great App
47,"When I first download the app they had an update, and none of the tutorials videos works. Upon contacting customer support they were more than helpful and provided working links to all the video within a timely manner. In addition, you can download all the swim workout as a pdf and print it out. However, It a bit of a bum but understandable that the garmin sync for easy workout transfer doesn’t work. However I was surprised they even offered the feature they also have it for Fitbit and Apple Watch.",5,Review
48,I have been using My Swim Pro for about two months and I am truly amazed at the ability of the app to create bespoke training plans for me.   Time seems to fly by now in the pool.  My technique and fitness are very clearly improving and I am enjoying the global MSP community tremendously.   I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.  Thank you SO much My Swim Pro!,5,"So grateful, and feel really lucky to have found MSP!"
50,"I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. 

The latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. 

No matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!",5,Continuous Improvement on an Already AMAZING APP
52,"My sister and I have taken up swimming in our 40’s after many years of running injuries. We grew up in Florida so we could swim before we could walk but never swam on a team.  We initially joined a Adult Summer swim league and had a blast!! We wanted to continue through the fall and winter and build up our endurance, strength and work on technique. The app makes this so easy as it has the workouts already planned for us we just bring our phone to the pool in the waterproof case and voila.",5,Worth the money
54,"This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season. This app’s workout structure is varied, purposeful, and expertly crafted - couldn’t ask for better. Also, in general, one of the best UI/UX designs in a fitness app I’ve ever used. If you swim or previously swam competitively in high school/college, get this app.",5,"If you swim, get this app."
57,"It took a bit to get this app dialed in on my Apple watch - but now that I’ve done that,  I’ll never be witout this app!!!  I love MySwimPro!

I’ve programmed in my workout, my watch vibrates (“swim now” prompt), I swim my 50m interval, touch the wall and wait for the next prompt.   No need to look at the watch…just wait for the next prompt and go (interval training).

I’m 65, heart attack and lung issues; but now I’m in the pool, regaining my health through swimming and MySwimpro is leading the way!  Thank you MySwimPro…you truly are a lifesaver.",5,Swim coach on my wrist!
58,"Having some problems with the app recording my pool sets, I reached out to Myswimpro and Charlie Brown replied. We were able to set up a WebCam meeting where Charlie successfully diagnosed the problems, walked me through the fix and everything works now as it should. I highly recommend the app and Charlie was both professional, friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend this product and the company. Great product and great customer service, five stars.",5,Help with app in Apple series 6 watch
60,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,4,Great but Limited
61,"Not only is this the best fitness app I’ve used, it might be one of the best apps I’ve ever used period. I’ve gone from swimming with no plan or intent to doing structured workouts and have improved immensely in only a couple weeks. The Apple Watch app can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly. I love the short videos they provide on technique as well. Highly recommend if you’re serious about improving your swimming!",5,Fantastic
63,"I had just started swimming again after not swimming for years and had recently became a lifeguard (again). I wanted to swim faster than my coworkers but just general fitness in general, so I took it upon myself for one of their annual sales for a year. Did it. I even had problems with the dry land part of the app syncing to my watch, CS (customer support) was more than happy to help with everything. All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",5,Dude. Love the app and the people.
65,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",5,"In theory great, in practice it’s so annoying"
70,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

Again, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.",5,"Fantastic Idea, Great Plans, Way too many bugs"
72,My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.  The Apps on iPhone and Apple Watch are both very well done and stable.  The paid subscription is well worth it.,5,Virtual coach that works!
74,I will say that this app finally got me back to swimming after 4 years of not being able to get back in the pool. I can’t get into a swim team because of reasons so I had the worst time in making workouts for me. This app is worth its money! The way it is structured helps me ADHD brain to finally commit on doing something. My overall life has just become better because if it. I can’t thank you guys enough!,5,Life changer
75,"As a former competitive swimmer getting back in the pool after 30 years, the workouts have been perfect in helping me get back up to speed. While I’ve got a long way to go, I’m not floundering around at the pool swimming junk yardage and made up sets. I’m looking forward to getting into the intermediate and advanced workouts. Plus there are multiple workouts for free, back, breast, IM, kick and sprint - really nothing short of hiring a coach to watch you. Highly recommend!",5,Love this app!
76,"****update*****. Administrator fixed the problem within 24 hours of my post. It’s a great app and now syncs with strava automatically.  *****update*****

****original post*****. App is good for recording swimming. I got it only so I could sync data to strava. Been trying for hours to get my workouts to sync. I give up. The accounts are linked, but ok upload. Deleted and reinstalled 3 times. Nothing. So I just manually input the data that this app records.  Oh well.",5,"Good for swimming, for strava not so much"
77,"With Master Swim sessions at my pool suspended, My Swim Pro has been a great help at improving the quality and focus of my workouts in the pool.  

The daily workouts keep things fresh for me  and It’s great to have the option of tweaking them to fit my needs in the APP.  I also love how MSP tracks and records my entire workout -so cool!!!

When Master Swim sessions come back to my pool I can tell you that MY Swim Pro will be with me for every stroke and kick.",5,Great Training Partner
78,I really like the ability to write my own workouts with intervals and rest times.  The cool thing is it buzzes when I need to go on the next ‘rep’.  I’m also counting challenged and sometimes forget where I am in a 400 or 500 - a quick glance can confirm where I am on that rep.  I appreciate that I have the option to sign up for a monthly subscription but am not required to to use the basic functionality of the app.  Great development and execution!,5,Great app
80,"I have really given this app a try for at least 3 months.  They fixed the issue of the Apple Watch not responding to the pressure to pause resume etc; but now 50% of the time the workout does not log;  although the workout appears  in the Health app of the iPhone, (and the data comes from the My Swim Pro) but it does not appear in the My Swim Pro app. I wish they could get it to work properly and consistently. Well $75 down the drain.",4,Disappointed
81,"I downloaded this app for my Fitbit verse two. When it was installed, I was trying to figure it out; when I set it all up, I chose a workout, then I went on my Fitbit, and then I tap load work out. It said,” connect to phone, error with the connection. ” but so far, I wouldn't grade this app for a lousy star rating. I think it needs to be connected to pads and iPhones. Even I am connected to the wifi; it does it too.",5,Good bad and between
83,I was a seasonal competitive swimmer but during the off-season I didn’t have any coaching. This app helped me improve my swimming in the same way a coach would. It gives detailed workouts hat are made for each individual and allows people to start from any fitness level and teach their goals at their own pace. I highly recommend to everyone who’s looking to get into the pool and be productive. No matter the skill level,5,Amazing app
84,"I was worried after my second back surgery that not only was my cycling race career over, but that my working out to stay healthy might be in peril, too. Thankfully, I got back in the water after a near 20 year hiatus. MySwimPro was a fundamentally significant part of my return not just to the pool and swimming, but even a bit of racing here and there. 5 medals in 5 races at my first Masters Nationals gave me the jolt to keep swimming and keep working. But, I always remember to swim happy!!",5,Swim Happy!
85,"I turned 45 in the middle of the weight loss program and this app has, no joke, changed my life haven’t really lost weight but I lost inches and have improved my cardio 5 fold and am now adding running and sprinting.  Most importantly this program combined with using the “expandalung” device has eliminated my asthma in a month and I’m not even finished the program, crazy.",5,Life changing
86,"Been loving the app for months, without issue but....In the last few weeks the pause function in the workout stopped working. I updated to the newest version and the problem was resolved until midway through a workout. I just tried it again and the swim workout cannot be stopped, paused, or otherwise interrupted during a workout. It’s very frustrating.",5,New glitch
87,"I have been using this app to train in the pool. My laps, strokes, time has been accurately uploaded to this app and Strava. I am also able to load the workouts. I currently have the Apple Watch 4 LTE and I’m sure it will work fine with the GPS only version. The app also automatically turns on the water lock on the phone and still lets you look at the screen when raising and looking at your wrist.",5,Works great on Apple Watch 4
92,Have been using MySwimPro for a few weeks now and I’m really enjoying how it keeps my workouts fresh and sequences them to push me to improve. I especially love the interval tracking and haptic feedback on the Apple Watch—it takes all the set thinking out of the picture and allows me to just focus on swimming hard :),5,Great tool for better swimming
93,This app really helped me keep track of my swim workouts when my swim team season ended I was trying to keep swimming an hour everyday but I wouldn’t have time to right down a workout and I was so used to my coaches making the workout that without them it was hard but this app really helped me keep track of what I was doing 10/10 recommend,5,GREAT!!!!
94,I’ve been a competitive swimmer for three years i’m 16 now and my club is on a month long break. i was looking for ways to not only stay in shape but get better while away at the same time taking a break from swim. these are the perfect workouts to work on whatever you might struggle with. a complete guide showing you what to do and when do it it’s amazing.,5,MYSWIMPRO DRYLAND
95,"The perfect training tool! With this app on my watch, I actually show up to the pool and get a tough workout in. I swam my whole life and played water polo in college. After college I struggled with swimming on my own, it’s just so boring! MySwimPro definitely helps with keeping me accountable. Perfect training for masters swimming and polo. Love tracking everything too, cause “numbers don’t lie!”",5,Helping this former collegiate water polo player get in shape
97,"As a former high school swimmer, I’ve been looking for a swim app that would not only record my stats but assist me with endurance, speed, and technique while physically in the pool. I can’t tell you how ecstatic I was after my first swim with this app. Total game changer !!! I can finally brag to my husband about all my metrics and geek out on all the analytics and swim plans!!! It’s like having your own personal coach on your wrist. Thank you!!!",5,Game changer
99,Have always been a swimmer. Needed some structure now that I live in an area without master swimming teams etc. Have been using this app for two years and appreciate it every time I complete a work out. Am not connected to a watch / device at this point and that is a little limiting at times.  Using Form goggles and only wish the two were connected.,5,Helped me get back into Seim shape
100,"I have been using this app for almost 3 months and just finished one of their training plans. It’s been a great experience both in and out of the pool as the team really listens to and welcomes feedback. 

It has a great swimming glossary built into the app to help clarify any terms you might not know. In addition to that it’s easy to use and saves you having to memorize or write down your routines.",4,You don’t have to swim like a pro to love this app
101,"Freaking LOVE this app! I wish it was easier to filter the workouts by things like equipment or add dynamic adjustments to intervals when you miss some, but those are really minor gripes. I love not having to write my own workouts but being able to customize the premade ones if I want to. This app has made lap swimming so much more fun!",5,"Best app, 10/10"
103,"I love this app, it makes swimming fun and I look forward to using it every day. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it does not keep track of my lap times very well which in turn messes up the swolf score, my best times and lap splits, etc. That being said, I have tried the available swim apps and this is still the best swim app out there!",4,Very user friendly
104,I love this app! As a swimmer this app is super user friendly and simple. I don’t have the premium version but the free routines they have are still good quality. I also love that you can make your own personal workout and track it. The only thing I wish for is more free routines. But besides that I love everything about this app.,5,Great App!
105,"As a swimmer there are many things you need to know, watch, learn, practice and count. Having a coach was something that helped but had limitations especially if you change countries and travel. Since I started with MySwimPro I felt the best professional coach I can ask for is back with me always whenever I need it.",5,Excellent swimming companion
106,MySwimPro sets the ‘gold standard’.   I’ve hesitated to write a review until I really put this app thru it’s paces. It has been almost 4 years  since I started using MySwimPro.   Communication with there team is excellent.  The diversity of workouts is endless and there are training plans for every need from the beginner to the triathlete or masters swimmer.,5,The one and only
109,"I encountered some issues that stopped the app from working at one point.  Thankfully, installing the most recent version fixed them.

The app makes it reasonably easy to write up and execute your own workouts.  Times recorded are not very accurate, but that may be more a function of the Apple watch than the app - each swim may be off by several seconds.",4,Issues fixed with new version
111,"I switched from Apple Watch app because I’m looking to get more accurate info on my work out. I’m having trouble to connect to Facebook to connect with people, it keeps on kicking me back out. Now on my Facebook page it shows I have the app connected and it gave me my work out notification. But I’m not able to connect on MySwimPro. I didn’t upgrade, is that why it’s not working?? Please help.",4,Facebook bugs
113,"I was in the process of completing one of the training plans when I took a 6 week break for vacation. I needed to restart the program and no matter what I did on the app, I wasn’t able to go back to the first set of workouts. I emailed support through the app and received instantaneous responses fixing the issue in a matter of moments. Love this app!!!",5,Great customer service!
114,I have been using the app a few months and have actually switched to an annual subscription due to the value I gained from it. It is the next best thing to having a live coach and their customer service is the best I have seen from any app developer. Definitely a smart investment for any level swimmer.,5,Fantastic app that actually works well on your watch
116,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do. It also forces me to do the sets at the correct training paces. I highly recommend it for anyone unable to join a team.",5,Awesome Coaching Program
120,"When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.",4,Does not record distance correctly
121,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,4,Nice app
123,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,5,New update not good
125,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",5,Has a lot of good features
126,"I usually don’t leave reviews but really wanted to support the guys building MySwimPro. My swimming has taken off since I started using the app on my Watch. The workouts are great and very motivational. I don’t have the time to attend a club, but having a training plan and guidance through the workout has proved very valuable. Thank you!",5,Revolutionized my swimming
129,"Fantastic app, total game changer. Gives new meaning to your swimming especially in conjunction with an Apple Watch. I bought one just for this reason. It is that good.

Can't wait to see where this is going in the future, in particular with respect to even more personalization and community!",5,Game changer
130,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,4,Endless pool
131,"This is a good app. I like it. But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well. At least I can connect my Fitbit to it and use the app into a train by session. You can log workouts and it’s very helpful! I only gave it four stars because there should be at least 2 free workouts.",4,Pretty good!
132,"I wish there was an app like this for every exercise. Would be great for track running and interval type workouts. Even regular lifting to a schedule would be great with this type of app.

Would love the opportunity to build my own workouts, but the workouts they provide are well done.",5,Perfect with Apple Watch
135,"I was using the Apple Watch swim activity and that normally worked fine but I was doing lengths with little purpose. MySwimPro has me working on improving my technique leading to better times and increased fitness. Plus, having a workout to complete means I normally end up doing more than I was before.",5,Best way to swim with purpose
136,"It’s not just about getting good at swimming, because you will. Nor is it just about getting fit, because you will. It’s about fostering community and inclusivity, encouraging excellence with enthusiasm, and having a lot of fun. The customer service team is on point, and no one will let you fail.",5,Community and Excellent
137,MySwimPro has made a huge difference in my swim workouts. There are SO MANY resources and great tech support. The personalized workouts really work for me. I have increased my swim skills and speed significantly since I started using it. I highly recommend it for anyone-at any skill level!,5,Love it!
138,"Actually closer than 2nd ... this app gives serious swimmers so much, to complain about its kinks is  ungenerous. That the app isn’t super slick is beside the point. That watches don’t do as advertised in many situations is not Myswimpro’s fault. This app opens a world of coaching and training advice. I love it.",5,Swimmers first software engineers second
139,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼,5,watchOS 6 🔥
140,"A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts. 

Thanks to the devs for their prompt and helpful support!",4,Great app with a bit of a learning curve for beginners
142,"I used to swim without a plan, which I see is a huge mistake. Swimming with MySwimPro is fun, stimulating, challenging, and I learn a lot from the training videos. I have other swimmers using it now at the Y. Highly recommend. I want to swim when I am 94 so please stay in business.",5,This app is the best!
143,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,4,Needs more free features/workouts
144,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting. 

I love myswimpro!!!",5,Super awesome app
147,"Updating a previous review - I had subscription issues but MySwimPro support resolved them very quickly. Now that I can use the app, I’m finding it to be great, a boost to my swim routine - so many tips and tools to optimize your workouts.",5,Really nice app
154,Can’t begins to describe how well-designed and intuitive this app is. MSP is a strong platform - the best out there and I’ve tried ‘em all. Lots of digital tools to support your training and growth. Excellent customer service if you ever need it.,5,Elegant and Effective
156,I am a former competitive swimmer who wasn’t pushing myself hard enough in the pool. This app provides excellent workouts and training programs that are challenging and satisfying. I love that it adjusts to MHz skill level. It syncs well with my Garmin watch. I have only great things to say about this app.,5,Love this app!
157,"I am a great user of this app but I had to uninstall it from my new Apple Watch (series 5), tried few times and it was unresponsive even after unlocking the waterproof mode. I am Waiting for a fix to enjoy the daily WOD again",5,Love this app but iwatch app needs fixing
160,Has good features and workouts but if your walls are decent it will not track your distance correctly. From there it’s far to cumbersome to return to the app and correct the distance.,4,Needs improvement
161,"Fantastic swim (and now dry land) programmes, generally very easy to use. Swim programmes are varied and you feel and see the results quickly. The dry land ones are like having a PT! 
Also, they’re very approachable, and fix any issues super quickly. Highly recommend.",5,Fantastic
162,"I uninstalled last year because it stopped recording without warning. Decided to give it another try. It was really sweet for 2 workouts, and now it’s back to not recording again.",5,Stops recording randomly
163,"Let’s finish the hassle to find a coach..

175,"I’ve been using the MSP app about a month and love it. Workouts are easy to follow and have helped improve my swim.  I also have had quick response when asking questions or needing advice.  Overall, great app.",5,Great App and support
177,I love the app but have to print out workouts to use with my garmin because when I use the watch to train it adds hundreds of yards to my swim. The workouts are great but hope the bug gets fixed.,5,Love the app
180,This thing is like being on dial up in 2001. I love it but I hate how it stalls and is so slow when I add my own workouts in. I updated and have all the new features but it’s still so friggin slow when I save my workout or tap on share. iPhone 8 Plus user.,4,Love the app... BUT
181,Great App. I synch it up with my Apple Watch and it delivers my workout set by set. There is always a workout of the day (WOD) and if that does not work for you there are plenty of others to choose from. Upgraded to Elite after a month of using the free App. Worth every penny!,4,Best swimming app
185,I enjoy learning all the new techniques to swim longer and stronger. I am a long time swimmer but have gotten away from it for years. Enjoy the community here within the swim pro app.,5,Swimmer
188,"When you pause the workout on the Apple Watch, it won’t resume no matter what buttons I try. I have to end my workout and restart, which makes it difficult to accurately track",4,Great app; One problem
189,"Yes, the app is expensive, but it has tremendous value for those that struggle to stay motivated with workouts. I like the variety in swimming and dry land workouts as I work to stay healthy.",5,Worth it!
190,"I really like the new format. The workouts are great and I like how you can adjust distances, times, number of reps, and save the workouts. It is much more functional.",5,New Format
191,"Great app, except you have to pay for all the workouts and whenever I go to the community page it bugs out and sends me to the home page",4,Good app
192,Integrated well with Strava on Apple Watch 4. It’s the only solution I could find for that purpose. Also recorded very accurately and the staff were helpful as I tried to configure things.,5,Works with Strava and Apple Watch 4
193,Not sure how I lived without MSP. I feel like I have my own personal coach. Workouts are great and engaging. Videos are helpful for someone like me. Love my swim log!!! Highly recommend to all my fishy friends.,5,No more guessing how long a lap takes :)
194,"This app is really helpful, whether I want a structured workout or just want it to log my swim in the pool. The information it provides after a swim is really great.",5,So helpful!
196,I have tried many trackers and swim focused plans. This is the best by far to keep you disciplined and help follow very well thought out work out plans .,5,The best app to get you to the next level
199,"I used this to basically relearn to swim as an adult and it’s turned me into a consistent lap swimmer. I can’t recommend it enough, especially now they dry and wet programs are integrated.",5,It’s great
200,Love this app.  Worth the money. I download workouts to my Garmin and do whatever it says. Improved my fitness and helped me when doctors told me to swim more and run less.,5,Makes swimming fun and challenging

221,Great swim workouts and great tracking. MySwimPro would be outstanding if it included a web-based interface that allowed users to use all of its features on a larger format.,4,"Love all of it, but ..."

345,Off to a great start in pool and dry land. Love the app,5,Day 1
360,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,4,Great! but too expensive
367,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",5,Most Helpful App for Swimming
368,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",5,Best way to record & improve my swimming
369,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",5,Best swimming app I've tried
370,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",5,HUGE Help!!!
371,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",4,"Great App, just needs something more."
372,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",4,Love it!
373,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",4,Great App for unaffiliated swimmers
374,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it's totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!",5,Changed the way I swim
375,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",5,Solid app
376,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",5,Finally! A swim workout app that works!
377,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance. If you can eventually make it stay on the screen, there is no way to end and log your workout; the time keeps going and it says ""Ending workout..."" until you delete the app and reinstall it.",5,Not reliable
379,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming. I love that I can track my progress, pick from a variety of sets, and customize my workouts to my ability.  The videos are helpful, especially for those just getting into swimming.  The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",5,Love this!
380,"But I do wish there was a place to put the desired workout time. As in approximately 30 minutes, 60 minutes, etc. The ability to add/remove parts of the workout help with this, but still wish there was a button to hit so the app can give me a good workout for the amount of time I have.",4,Haven't put it to use yet
384,I'm a lifeguard and at my job we are required to swim a lot. I  try to swim more so I can increase my strokes and to stay fit. This is a great app! However I wish there was a way to upload our own workouts so that I wouldn't have to pay for majority of them.  But it's a nice overall.,4,Great App
385,"I have been using this app for a couple of weeks now and I have had very positive results with it. 

Easy to use, and with very helpful mini tutorials for strokes and techniques that help achieve proper form and overall ability to achieve a professional workout. 

Highly recommend.",5,"If you swim, get this app!!!"
388,"I love this app! I use it if practice ever gets canceled. I'll write down the set, take it to the pool, and when I get back I log my swim! Maybe in the next update, there could be a feature where you can save the workout and edit the times you have to make. Great app, 5 stars!",5,Awesome!
390,I am a swimmer who was looking for an app that would help me improve and track all aspects of my performance and MySwimPro really delivered. It provides challenging workouts and I already can feel my stroke improving. I would recommend MySwimPro to anyone looking to improve their swimming.,5,Fantastic app
392,Every single day I use this app it grows on me. Tracking workouts/stats/progress is very rewarding. Having followers helps drive accountability. Follow others to see what workouts your friends are doing. Double bonus with the large library of custom workouts.,5,MSP
396,"This app works great! I have checked it out, and everything is flawless! The amount of opportunities are endless (and for free, too)! I think it's so cool how you can get customized workouts, down to the very last detail. Thank you for making this app!",5,Amazing!!!
397,"I got injured and couldn't run for several months. This app helped me get through weeks of cross training with lots of different workouts, goals and new drills. I like having an exact plan to follow. Thanks for videos and definitions.",5,Helpful for cross training
400,"Once I figured out that I needed to manually allow the app to access data obtained from the watch, it worked great. Might want to make that component more straightforward.",4,Seems like a decent app
402,This app is awesome for those who like to train by themselves or  for those who need help creating swimming workouts! I'm a triathlete and needed some help creating a training set!,5,If you're a newbie or an experienced swimmer this app is for you!
404,"Super app, it’s full of helpful information, tips and recommendations. I have just started to use it and already got first results. I improved my swimming speed by using the right technique.",5,Wow
405,This app is sweet. The best part is I can get individualized training based on my goals not just a generic set of workouts. Still experimenting with the options but video instructions are great as well. Thx!,5,Personalized Training at its best!
406,This app has changed the way I train. I used to be mediocre but this app helped me improve to levels I didn't think were possible.,5,Life Changing
407,I began swimming after stress injuries from running. This breaks down the workouts and gives great structure to my swims. Highly recommend for anyone looking to get more out of their pool time.,5,Great for beginners
408,"I'm a super novice, so this app was a godsend helping me walk through what to do and get an actual workout from my swimming instead of flopping about! Very easy",5,Great for learning and workout
410,This app is revolutionary! I love my FitBit and this app is basically the equivalent of it for swimmers! It's really easy to use and it will only get better I'm sure. Totally worth the download!!,5,Excellent training app

416,Great for recreational use!! The simplicity of the app makes it easy enough for anyone to use and benefit from.,5,Very well Designed
417,"This is a great app for beginners who don't know how to structure a workout. I like the fact that it breaks down your workout in a circle graphic.

It also tells you approximate calories burned.

You can choose from the many workouts in a specific area you want to work (sprint, distance) or create your own personalized workout.

Excellent app, keep it up myswimpro!",5,Excellent app.
418,So simple and easy to use. Videos are very informational and sets are challenging. Definitely recommend for everyone.,5,Amazing!!

488,THIS APP IS DOPE!,5,Dope app
492,"This app finally got me back in the pool, after a ten-year hiatus. The workouts are interesting, go by quickly, and I’m so pleased to see real progress. When I was trying to swim without it, I was doing maybe 1000-1500k but I’m back at 3-4K workouts, like I did in high school. Just did my first dryland workout and I like the format of that, too! I recommend it to all the swimmers in my life :)",5,So worth it :)
494,"I started swimming 4 years ago at the age of 50 and stumbled upon this app through the YouTube videos that taught me how to swim. For 2+ years I put off paying the “extra” money for the coaching and other features available. Now that I did purchase the coaching, I have ZERO regrets. My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",5,Incredible App and Support
495,"Apple Watch Swim mode doesn’t  track kick drills. MySwimPro does.  It even reminds you if you forgot to switch into drill mode, (GPS😵‍💫). Also, be careful pairing with Strava on Apple Watch. It’ll record the same workout twice.",5,Revised  10/7/21
500,"It’s a great app! I wish the yearly cost would go down a bit but I like it. It’s really helped me improve my swimming and help make me stronger. One of my problems is that I don’t have a 6 digit code come up on my watch, though I don’t know if the problems from the app or my watch. If I could get an answer that would be nose. Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",4,Great app! One problem
503,"I have gone through all the updates and swim 5-6 times per week. Logging from Apple Watch 2 has stopped. The info goes into my activity and HeartWatch apps but logging is not happening on the MySwimPro app itself! Cmon man! The social feed stuff is cute, but at least get the log to work for our own history so we can repeat workouts we like or improve on total workout times, etc before you bog my stuff down with cutsie social media fodder. Going on 2year premium user but have no qualms about going back to a ziplock with a printed workout.

10-16-18 update. Logging seems to be fixed. Changed rating to 4 instead of 2 stars. I hope the main focus continues to be on the basic functionality working PERFECTLY in the midst of the desire to add more “neato” features.",4,Logging???
508,"I've used this app 3 times and all 3 times I got inaccurate lap counts. Seems to be way off the count by 800-900 yards. I usually swim 3500 to 4000 yards and it will only count 2600-3100 .. that's a big difference. And yes I'm doing all the right things .. not stopping in middle of my
Laps, I make sure I have a good turn and push off. This morning I was finishing up a 3500 yard swim .. my lap count was 2600... I was doing my 100 yard cool down.. when I reached the end of my laps .. I noticed the app had crashed and I lost totally lost my swim.. needless to say I'm going to delete this app. Worthless!",5,Dissatisfied
