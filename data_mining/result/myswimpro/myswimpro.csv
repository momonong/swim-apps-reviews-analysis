0,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",4,My Swim Pro Review
1,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",5,Great investment
2,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",5,From Analytics to Coaching
3,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",5,You can’t believe all that’s packed into this subscription.
4,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",4,Great but not fail safe
5,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",2,Complicated
6,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",5,Great for Pool and Open Water
7,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",5,"Seriously, Best Swim App Available"
8,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",5,"Very useful, but a few issues"
9,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",3,I bet it works great with Apple watches…
10,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",5,"Love, love, love this app!"
11,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",3,Great idea w/ ok execution. Buyer beware
12,"I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.",5,"Great Swimming App, BUT had to uninstall/reinstall after latest update"
13,"I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  
Please respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.  Remember if it’s not broken why do u have to mess with it!",1,What is going on?
14,"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it. 

I can’t wait to see what goals I hit from now til winter! And I love that you can use GPS for free open water swim or put in how long your pool is. I also can’t wait to do this at the beach!",5,I use this with my Apple Watch Series 6
15,"I am at 67 a new swimmer . I cannot begin to explain the benefit that this app and the outstanding customer support has bestowed to me. I started out needing to rest after 25 meters . Going to the pool to swim was a source of anxiety and I went because I knew it was in my best interest. Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training . You want to just swim go ahead and enjoy but if you want to improve and become engaged in a fun healthy sport ? Stop wasting your time sign up and join all of us at MySeimPro community . Go ahead , I dare you !",5,Simply amazing
16,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",5,Can't say enough great things about this app!
17,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",1,"Works well when it does, but when it doesn’t..."
18,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",2,Doesn’t track basic laps
19,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",1,False Advertising
20,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",4,Great app in need of a few tweaks
21,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",5,SPECTACULAR APP!!
22,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",2,Once crash too many
23,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",4,It’s great now
24,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",1,Horrible
25,"This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved. 

I recently had an issue with my account and the customer service was on point. I got an immediate response and my issue was resolved with that one response. Keep up the great work, MySwimPro!",5,Awesome app. Wonderful customer service
26,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",3,Stop telling me about all your upgrades
27,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",2,The 4 and 5 star reviews are wrong
28,"I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",5,Great app
29,"While the app itself is amazing between the video demos, training options, workouts, and tracking available, the customer service is what has made me come and place this review. I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",5,Great customer support
30,"This app is amazing and the customer service is awesome! I had been a swimmer growing up and always had access to a coach. But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming. I’ve lost more weight than I thought I could, I’m swimming faster now than when I was a kid and I feel like I’m apart of a community. This app really changed my life for the better.",5,Lost 20 pounds already- life changing
31,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",3,Watch metrics not accurate
32,"I really do like this app. I love that it gives analytics on distance per stroke. I wear an Apple
Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",4,Like not love
33,"Live the app! The best part I enjoy are all the videos and how exercises are explained throughly. There are lots of exercises in workouts and videos to explain before activities, and you can change during workouts. 

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",5,Review
34,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",1,No longer worth it
35,"I am in my late 50s, was a swimmer in HS and college and really came back to the sport because I needed low impact on my knees. I have loved this app for almost 3 yrs. 
I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim. 
Go MSP Team!",5,What a way to come through in this time of pool closures!
36,"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",3,"Good app, but way overpriced"
37,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",2,Not Worth It
38,"For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.",1,"Janky app, terrible workouts"
39,"I went to the pool today and planned on using my watch and Swim Pro! Nope, I was greeted with tiny print telling me, nah, this app requires me to get permission! I’m sitting with my legs in the water and ready to start laps and no the app is NOT going to track my laps. And it didn’t. Useless! I paid for an app for swimming and it refused to work. If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry. I pay to swim and paid for an app. Useless!
I have been to the pool 3 times with this app. Nothing works. Garbage. 
There needs to be instructions on setting it up and using it. Instead, it wants to sell upgrades. I hate it!",1,Cumbersome to use
40,"I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",4,Really Awesome App But Needs Small Improvements
41,"When I signed up and filled in my profile info there was a workout.  Paid my subscription fee and went to pool. When I opened app there was a confusing amount of info and the workout included dryland etc. My profile did not include dryland, and it did include my available workout time.   The workout I saw before subscription was good. After I paid … totally different and I’m not able to stop and fiddle on my phone in the bright sun.  I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.  Very disappointed and wishing I didn’t spend money on this nonsense.",1,Confusing and costly
42,"Used the app with my Garmin Fenix 5S pro today for the first time. Already seeing the bugs that previous reviewers have mentioned. Even though my settings across Garmin, this app, and my watch are all set to yards and miles, it kept switching back-and-forth between meters and yards and then it was short changing me on the yards. It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash. I like the idea of workouts but this is going to drive me nuts and not sure I’m willing to pay for something that doesn’t work properly.",2,Can you make this sync properly with Garmin?
43,"This isn’t really a critique it’s more me asking if a feature could be added. I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well. 

Thank you.",5,Paddling Feature Request
44,Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid. Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.,5,Getting back in water from being out for 2 years
45,My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.,1,Freezes on Apple Watch
46,"I began training and racing in triathlons last year. Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.",5,Great App
47,"When I first download the app they had an update, and none of the tutorials videos works. Upon contacting customer support they were more than helpful and provided working links to all the video within a timely manner. In addition, you can download all the swim workout as a pdf and print it out. However, It a bit of a bum but understandable that the garmin sync for easy workout transfer doesn’t work. However I was surprised they even offered the feature they also have it for Fitbit and Apple Watch.",5,Review
48,I have been using My Swim Pro for about two months and I am truly amazed at the ability of the app to create bespoke training plans for me.   Time seems to fly by now in the pool.  My technique and fitness are very clearly improving and I am enjoying the global MSP community tremendously.   I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.  Thank you SO much My Swim Pro!,5,"So grateful, and feel really lucky to have found MSP!"
49,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

tl;dr. this app is only for swimmers who are primarily concerned with lap times and who don’t have a team and are willing to pay for a pretty expensive app.",1,"no value to free version, paid is too expensive"
50,"I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. 

The latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. 

No matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!",5,Continuous Improvement on an Already AMAZING APP
51,"I’m done with this app. Don’t get me wrong this app is great and I’ve loved using it as I’ve gotten back into swimming. However somehow I got logged out of my account and couldn’t remember the password I used when I first set up the app. I’ve requested several password resets over the course of a week and have not received one in my inbox, spam, or junk folders. I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.",1,Poor customer support
52,"My sister and I have taken up swimming in our 40’s after many years of running injuries. We grew up in Florida so we could swim before we could walk but never swam on a team.  We initially joined a Adult Summer swim league and had a blast!! We wanted to continue through the fall and winter and build up our endurance, strength and work on technique. The app makes this so easy as it has the workouts already planned for us we just bring our phone to the pool in the waterproof case and voila.",5,Worth the money
53,"First off I’m just starting off swimming and have used the app once with my watch and it seems to have done what I was hoping it would do.  I’m not a sophisticated swimmer so I can’t comment on all the analytics etc. 

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. 

Well you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.",2,Frustrating Subscription Options
54,"This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season. This app’s workout structure is varied, purposeful, and expertly crafted - couldn’t ask for better. Also, in general, one of the best UI/UX designs in a fitness app I’ve ever used. If you swim or previously swam competitively in high school/college, get this app.",5,"If you swim, get this app."
55,"Meh. It’s ok. Downloaded it for the drill/kick set mode. That part is fine. I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements). Lots of great potential here but a lot to be desired…maybe in time it’ll improve. At least I didn’t spend money on it.",3,Meh. Ok. Lots of room for improvement
56,"Recently got a series 3 AppleWatch and was looking for a good swim workout app. Most of the reviews were positive for MSP so I thought I’d give it a shot. Prior to the recent update it was great, I’m not a pro swimmer so the basic features do just fine. Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming. I cleared the cache on my phone & watch, restarted the watch and it still doesn’t work right. I would have given it a higher mark because I like the app but it is now broken & virtually unusable to me...",2,Recent Update Issues
57,"It took a bit to get this app dialed in on my Apple watch - but now that I’ve done that,  I’ll never be witout this app!!!  I love MySwimPro!

I’ve programmed in my workout, my watch vibrates (“swim now” prompt), I swim my 50m interval, touch the wall and wait for the next prompt.   No need to look at the watch…just wait for the next prompt and go (interval training).

We were able to set up a WebCam meeting where Charlie successfully diagnosed the problems, walked me through the fix and everything works now as it should. I highly recommend the app and Charlie was both professional, friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend this product and the company. Great product and great customer service, five stars.",5,Help with app in Apple series 6 watch
59,"Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",1,Crashed and nothing logged
60,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,4,Great but Limited
61,"Not only is this the best fitness app I’ve used, it might be one of the best apps I’ve ever used period. I’ve gone from swimming with no plan or intent to doing structured workouts and have improved immensely in only a couple weeks. The Apple Watch app can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly. I love the short videos they provide on technique as well. Highly recommend if you’re serious about improving your swimming!",5,Fantastic
62,"I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",2,Great until yesterday
63,"I had just started swimming again after not swimming for years and had recently became a lifeguard (again). I wanted to swim faster than my coworkers but just general fitness in general, so I took it upon myself for one of their annual sales for a year. Did it. I even had problems with the dry land part of the app syncing to my watch, CS (customer support) was more than happy to help with everything. All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",5,Dude. Love the app and the people.
64,"I took me a really long time to just log a swim workout just now and every time I clicked “save” to add a set, pops up their ad to subscribe monthly or annually, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",2,"Great App, updates are too much"
65,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",5,"In theory great, in practice it’s so annoying"
66,"Up until this summer, I was able to create a simple workout and that was good for me - I know my times, I’m not looking to win medals or meets, but just wanted something that tracks workouts and tells me when to push off the wall. Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable. Even if they’d have offered an inexpensive option to just make your own workouts, I could be on board, but this isn’t worth the hassle.",1,"Free version is useless, borderline false advertising"
67,"UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$. 

DON’T waste your time or money. Try other apps.",1,Don’t waste your time or $$
68,"After using for approx 3 months, 2-3 times a week I have to say, I am not happy. Around 40-45 minutes into any workout, randomly the watch app closes. And it’s not every time. Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank. Which means it didn’t record over to Strava or my health app on Apple. Overall I like it, which is why it got 3. But it is very frustrating to find the app closed after a workout is not quite done.",3,Random Shuts Down
69,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",2,"Fiddly, Naggy and Tracks Poorly"
70,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

Again, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.",5,"Fantastic Idea, Great Plans, Way too many bugs"
71,"I couldn’t tell what I was supposed to do because it was too confusing. I paid for the full membership around 7 months ago, and I’m supposed to have quarterly 1:1 with a coach to help me, but aside from the first meet (which I didn’t know was video chat with the owner, my “coach” and some other guy), I’ve not received any kind of contact since. And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming. I genuinely wish I hadn’t paid for it, but I definitely cancelled my subscription so I’m not charged again.",1,What even is it
72,My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.  The Apps on iPhone and Apple Watch are both very well done and stable.  The paid subscription is well worth it.,5,Virtual coach that works!
73,"My workout plan doesn’t sync with Apple watch at all. Workout often doesn’t register in the app. I’ve tried all of the steps recommended to remedy these bugs to no avail. It work seamlessly about four or five updates ago. I wish I could back. Even more disappointing give the coming price increase. As helpful as it is, a clunky app isnt worth a $1000 lifetime subscription. The yearly price increase (not yet announced) may be too steep without improvement in performance of the app.",3,much more buggy since most recent updates
74,I will say that this app finally got me back to swimming after 4 years of not being able to get back in the pool. I can’t get into a swim team because of reasons so I had the worst time in making workouts for me. This app is worth its money!

75,"As a former competitive swimmer getting back in the pool after 30 years, the workouts have been perfect in helping me get back up to speed. While I’ve got a long way to go, I’m not floundering around at the pool swimming junk yardage and made up sets. I’m looking forward to getting into the intermediate and advanced workouts. Plus there are multiple workouts for free, back, breast, IM, kick and sprint - really nothing short of hiring a coach to watch you. Highly recommend!",5,Love this app!

78,I really like the ability to write my own workouts with intervals and rest times.  The cool thing is it buzzes when I need to go on the next ‘rep’.  I’m also counting challenged and sometimes forget where I am in a 400 or 500 - a quick glance can confirm where I am on that rep.

79,"I'm sure this app does a lot of great things but I only wanted to use the free version to log my own workouts using the Quick Log feature. But after logging my first workout the app will no longer easily let me change the minutes (duration) of my swim--it takes 10+ tries to change the time, if it works at all. It's frustrating and hard to gauge my pace without an accurate time. Any fix for this? I do like that it connects to Strava.",3,Can't set minutes in Quick Log feature

It was very upsetting for me that EVERYTHING, from technique videos to training plans, all required payment to continue. As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee.

I highly recommend to everyone who’s looking to get into the pool and be productive. No matter the skill level,5,Amazing app
84,"I was worried after my second back surgery that not only was my cycling race career over, but that my working out to stay healthy might be in peril, too. Thankfully, I got back in the water after a near 20 year hiatus. MySwimPro was a fundamentally significant part of my return not just to the pool and swimming, but even a bit of racing here and there. 5 medals in 5 races at my first Masters Nationals gave me the jolt to keep swimming and keep working. But, I always remember to swim happy!!",5,Swim Happy!
85,"I turned 45 in the middle of the weight loss program and this app has, no joke, changed my life haven’t really lost weight but I lost inches and have improved my cardio 5 fold and am now adding running and sprinting.  Most importantly this program combined with using the “expandalung” device has eliminated my asthma in a month and I’m not even finished the program, crazy.",5,Life changing
86,"Been loving the app for months, without issue but....In the last few weeks the pause function in the workout stopped working. I updated to the newest version and the problem was resolved until midway through a workout. I just tried it again and the swim workout cannot be stopped, paused, or otherwise interrupted during a workout. It’s very frustrating.",5,New glitch
87,"I have been using this app to train in the pool. My laps, strokes, time has been accurately uploaded to this app and Strava. I am also able to load the workouts. I currently have the Apple Watch 4 LTE and I’m sure it will work fine with the GPS only version. The app also automatically turns on the water lock on the phone and still lets you look at the screen when raising and looking at your wrist.",5,Works great on Apple Watch 4
88,"I wanted to try this app out because it had great reviews and others I know use it. The signup process was tedious, the amount of emails I have received already is overwhelming, and when I tried to watch some videos through the iOS and iPadOS app, the video would try to launch, but then it would close the video immediately after trying to watch.

It was enough of a bad experience within the first 5 minutes to turn me away given the high price tag. I would hope that this money would be put to good use developing a high quality app that works.",1,First Impression was not good
89,I got this app so I can customize my workouts and swim at my own pace. After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.  I suggest you create an option where the user can only customize their workouts and log their workouts. All the other stuff on there I don’t even look at.,2,So disappointed
90,"The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. 

This behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. 

It’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.",2,Too frustrating to recommend
91,I found the description to be a bit misleading for a free app. Yes the app is free but there is nothing you can do with out the paid subscription. I’m training for a triathlon and wanted a good resource to help with swimming workouts but the 7 day trial isn’t a long enough evaluation period for me to see if I want to spend $20/month on an subscription. I can track swimming on my Apple Watch so I don’t need the app without the premium features at all.  I thought that was a too costly considering I can’t tell what I would really be getting since everything is locked down. No thanks.,2,Subscription Required
92,Have been using MySwimPro for a few weeks now and I’m really enjoying how it keeps my workouts fresh and sequences them to push me to improve. I especially love the interval tracking and haptic feedback on the Apple Watch—it takes all the set thinking out of the picture and allows me to just focus on swimming hard :),5,Great tool for better swimming
93,This app really helped me keep track of my swim workouts when my swim team season ended I was trying to keep swimming an hour everyday but I wouldn’t have time to right down a workout and I was so used to my coaches making the workout that without them it was hard but this app really helped me keep track of what I was doing 10/10 recommend,5,GREAT!!!!
94,I’ve been a competitive swimmer for three years i’m 16 now and my club is on a month long break. i was looking for ways to not only stay in shape but get better while away at the same time taking a break from swim. these are the perfect workouts to work on whatever you might struggle with. a complete guide showing you what to do and when do it it’s amazing.,5,MYSWIMPRO DRYLAND
95,"The perfect training tool! With this app on my watch, I actually show up to the pool and get a tough workout in. I swam my whole life and played water polo in college. After college I struggled with swimming on my own, it’s just so boring! MySwimPro definitely helps with keeping me accountable. Perfect training for masters swimming and polo. Love tracking everything too, cause “numbers don’t lie!”",5,Helping this former collegiate water polo player get in shape
96,"I’m a swimmer on a team who likes to track down what we do every day. We swim about 2 times a day for 6 days a week and whenever I try recording my times from meets, it doesn’t even record down the time and I have to do it all over again. It’s very buggy and it’s split recording isn’t good. The good part about this app is that it makes it easier to record our practices and times but however, with these problems it makes it nearly impossible to.",3,It’s a good app but has some problems
97,"As a former high school swimmer, I’ve been looking for a swim app that would not only record my stats but assist me with endurance, speed, and technique while physically in the pool. I can’t tell you how ecstatic I was after my first swim with this app. Total game changer !!! I can finally brag to my husband about all my metrics and geek out on all the analytics and swim plans!!! It’s like having your own personal coach on your wrist. Thank you!!!",5,Game changer
98,"Been using for years and used to like it a lot. I understand the developers have to make money, but these days it’s quite annoying to use this app if you don’t need any to sign up for one of their paid subscriptions. It’s constantly barraging you to subscribe, make a training plain, etc. 

If you want to use this app as your coach it’s probably a good one. But if you just want to track your swimming activity, there are probably better options now.",2,Only worth if you have a paid subscription
99,Have always been a swimmer. Needed some structure now that I live in an area without master swimming teams etc. Have been using this app for two years and appreciate it every time I complete a work out. Am not connected to a watch / device at this point and that is a little limiting at times.  Using Form goggles and only wish the two were connected.,5,Helped me get back into Seim shape
100,"I have been using this app for almost 3 months and just finished one of their training plans. It’s been a great experience both in and out of the pool as the team really listens to and welcomes feedback. 

It has a great swimming glossary built into the app to help clarify any terms you might not know. In addition to that it’s easy to use and saves you having to memorize or write down your routines.",4,You don’t have to swim like a pro to love this app
101,"Freaking LOVE this app! I wish it was easier to filter the workouts by things like equipment or add dynamic adjustments to intervals when you miss some, but those are really minor gripes. I love not having to write my own workouts but being able to customize the premade ones if I want to. This app has made lap swimming so much more fun!",5,"Best app, 10/10"
102,Having to unlock the watch just to switch the reps is very difficult because there is water on the watch and that messes with the screen heavily. Only way it’s possible is to dry your hands and the watch every time. My suggest is being able to double click the crown button or side button to switch reps. I think this is a pretty big pit fall which is why I gave 3 stars. Otherwise it’s a great app.,3,Switching reps is less than ideal
103,"I love this app, it makes swimming fun and I look forward to using it every day. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it does not keep track of my lap times very well which in turn messes up the swolf score, my best times and lap splits, etc. That being said, I have tried the available swim apps and this is still the best swim app out there!",4,Very user friendly
104,I love this app! As a swimmer this app is super user friendly and simple. I don’t have the premium version but the free routines they have are still good quality. I also love that you can make your own personal workout and track it. The only thing I wish for is more free routines. But besides that I love everything about this app.,5,Great App!
105,"As a swimmer there are many things you need to know, watch, learn, practice and count. Having a coach was something that helped but had limitations especially if you change countries and travel. Since I started with MySwimPro I felt the best professional coach I can ask for is back with me always whenever I need it.",5,Excellent swimming companion
106,MySwimPro sets the ‘gold standard’.   I’ve hesitated to write a review until I really put this app thru it’s paces. It has been almost 4 years  since I started using MySwimPro.   Communication with there team is excellent.  The diversity of workouts is endless and there are training plans for every need from the beginner to the triathlete or masters swimmer.,5,The one and only
107,"This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

* Initially Garmin sync would reset itself every time I entered “Account Settings”. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get that working as expected.

It’s a real pity as pool swimming can be quite monotonous without a coaching aspect.",1,Shady trial structure and Garmin 735 issues
108,"I have been using the app since it was launched. Today I use it to measure pace, etc. I utilize the sync/import my workouts feature for the most part. However since the last couple of updates, they have come through broken. My 200s come through as 25s, 75s…even though when I look at them in the iOS Fitness app they are tracking together. Please take a look. Thx",3,Please fix swim import feature
109,"I encountered some issues that stopped the app from working at one point.  Thankfully, installing the most recent version fixed them.

The app makes it reasonably easy to write up and execute your own workouts.  Times recorded are not very accurate, but that may be more a function of the Apple watch than the app - each swim may be off by several seconds.",4,Issues fixed with new version
110,"It is a good app with good plans. I use it most every day. The biggest issue is it doesn’t work with high end Garmin watches to export swim plans although it sells this as a feature. I have the MK1 and integrating between the app and devices is so complicated and never works. Even their customer service team could t figure it out.  

This also isn’t a product for people on a budget. You can find so many free workouts online. So it’s good but could be great. Just do your research.",2,Poor Integration for Garmin Swimming
111,"I switched from Apple Watch app because I’m looking to get more accurate info on my work out. I’m having trouble to connect to Facebook to connect with people, it keeps on kicking me back out. Now on my Facebook page it shows I have the app connected and it gave me my work out notification. But I’m not able to connect on MySwimPro. I didn’t upgrade, is that why it’s not working?? Please help.",4,Facebook bugs
112,"I have a Garmin watch and I can’t see any benefits of using the free app, the info appears to be about the same you get for free with your watch app. It seems the Apple Watch features are great for doing workouts in the pool. However, there are no free workouts, everything has to be paid for, even stuff that is free on their website and the price is really ridiculous if you just want the workouts. May be worth it if there is actually a proper coaching strategy but not sure that’s the case, didn’t even go for their free trial. Deleted.",1,Only makes sense if you have an Apple Watch and lots of money
113,"I was in the process of completing one of the training plans when I took a 6 week break for vacation. I needed to restart the program and no matter what I did on the app, I wasn’t able to go back to the first set of workouts. I emailed support through the app and received instantaneous responses fixing the issue in a matter of moments. Love this app!!!",5,Great customer service!
114,I have been using the app a few months and have actually switched to an annual subscription due to the value I gained from it. It is the next best thing to having a live coach and their customer service is the best I have seen from any app developer. Definitely a smart investment for any level swimmer.,5,Fantastic app that actually works well on your watch
115,"I love all the features of this app and it truly is top notch. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is unreasonably high. I understand the amount of work and the excellence that went into this, but it doesn’t serve people who need an app like this that is reasonably affordable. I already pay a gym membership premium. Having this would be excellent for training, but would be like adding an additional gym membership to my budget. 
If the subscription is ever lowered substantially, count me in!",2,Great app! Too expensive
116,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do. It also forces me to do the sets at the correct training paces. I highly recommend it for anyone unable to join a team.",5,Awesome Coaching Program
117,The workouts are not challenging or tailored to my performance—annoying since the app has spent nearly 2 years collecting my data. The videos and various workouts can all be found (better) on the internet. Hardly worth $119. You’ll also receive all sorts of emails and “training” videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they’re in a partnership with—like a $200 device to build lung capacity. This may be helpful for beginners but if you’re an intermediate or above swimmer it’s not worth the money.,2,Why bother
118,"I downloaded this app with high hopes. Unfortunately I encountered multiple issues right from the start, and eventually gave up and deleted it. 

After downloading the app to my phone and registering, I tried to open the app on my watch. It didn’t recognize that I had registered on my phone and wouldn’t move past the login screen. I had to restart my watch for it to log in. 

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. 

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout. 

3 restarts in the first 10 min of using the app. Don’t waste your time.",1,Don’t waste your time
119,"I can’t advise this enough - RUN and do not do the trial. I didn’t remember signing up for a year subscription, just a 7 day trial that would result in a monthly fee after. I was automatically charged $100 after 7 days. I stopped using the app after the first swim, as it shuts off my Apple Watch ability to track data using Apple Health. I cannot find a customer support number anywhere, even though they promise their “premium” members ample support. More like endless links to wiki articles with no human in sight. Don’t make this mistake folks. This is a fraudulent app.",1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE - Charged $100 for deleted app
120,"When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.",4,Does not record distance correctly
121,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,4,Nice app
122,"Getting to connect is difficult, and keeping connected even more. I have an Ionic, I loaded a workout last night, tried to use it this morning and it was fine, had to leave the pool to go get the phone to load it again. Then the app would not work because it the watch was not connected to the phone (had synchronized a minute before). Finally, I got the workout in, dis the workout and the data never made it to Fitbit dashboard. I also have an Apple Watch, I’m gonna test it with it, if it doesn’t work I’m deleting this app, so far not worth the money.",1,NOT for Fitbit
123,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,5,New update not good
124,"The app looks great there are a lot of workout options and I liked the layout inside the workouts…when I could see it. Which brings me to why I’m giving it 3 stars, 99.9% of the app is behind a pay wall and it’s expensive. To pay for it on top of the gym membership to access the pool is not worth it. Especially since it doesn’t even sync with my smart watch (Fitbit).",3,Looks great but…
125,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",5,Has a lot of good features
126,"I usually don’t leave reviews but really wanted to support the guys building MySwimPro. My swimming has taken off since I started using the app on my Watch. The workouts are great and very motivational. I don’t have the time to attend a club, but having a training plan and guidance through the workout has proved very valuable. Thank you!",5,Revolutionized my swimming

Not sure why it is not working at all The app swimpro stuck frozen on 2 screens - first screen: profiles stats: showing miles, hors & workouts - second screen : message : Apple Watch ultra has a resistance water of 100 But the app frozen on this message : we don't recommend swimming with, or submerging an Apple Watch that is not rated water resistance 50 meters. Pls advise",3,Not working with Apple Ultra watch
128,"i was impressed with apple watch's built in swim tracking, it would pay attention to when I was moving and when I wasn't, logged pace per lap accurately

I was happy to try MySwimPro because I appreciate all the how-to videos, but when running a 100yd exercise, if I only get half that done in the goal time, the watch still logs 100yds, so I have no idea how far I actually swam.",3,Isn't logging exercises accurately
129,"Fantastic app, total game changer. Gives new meaning to your swimming especially in conjunction with an Apple Watch. I bought one just for this reason. It is that good.

Can't wait to see where this is going in the future, in particular with respect to even more personalization and community!",5,Game changer
130,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,4,Endless pool
131,"This is a good app. I like it. But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well. At least I can connect my Fitbit to it and use the app into a train by session. You can log workouts and it’s very helpful! I only gave it four stars because there should be at least 2 free workouts.",4,Pretty good!
132,"I wish there was an app like this for every exercise. Would be great for track running and interval type workouts. Even regular lifting to a schedule would be great with this type of app.

Would love the opportunity to build my own workouts, but the workouts they provide are well done.",5,Perfect with Apple Watch
133,"I’ve really appreciated using this app on my iwatch, dug how it pushes your workout/set details into Strava, but with iOS9 on my iwatch8  stops recording as soon as I hit the water. Not sure what’s up. I’ve tried starting it several times and the app just closes.  Not sure if it’s a bug with iOS9, a bug with low power mode for workouts, etc.   regardless I Had to go back to relying on another app :(.   Let me know if I can provide any other feedback to help problem solve. 

Best to your dev team 🤘🏼",1,New version crashing w iOS9.5.2
134,"At 3 times the price of comparable apps I expect an app that works. Display while swimming is nicer than Apple Watch and it’s nice that some programs are included and displayed on screen but lap counts are less accurate than apples native app, the program is constantly wrong about which ones I have completed and the way it dynamically tries to update my times is way off. Will be trying out some other apps or sticking with Apple watch’s swim tracker as advantages over a printed swim workout are minimal.",1,Buggy and overpriced
135,"I was using the Apple Watch swim activity and that normally worked fine but I was doing lengths with little purpose. MySwimPro has me working on improving my technique leading to better times and increased fitness. Plus, having a workout to complete means I normally end up doing more than I was before.",5,Best way to swim with purpose

138,"Actually closer than 2nd ... this app gives serious swimmers so much, to complain about its kinks is  ungenerous. That the app isn’t super slick is beside the point. That watches don’t do as advertised in many situations is not Myswimpro’s fault. This app opens a world of coaching and training advice. I love it.",5,Swimmers first software engineers second
139,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼,5,watchOS 6 🔥
140,"A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts. 

Thanks to the devs for their prompt and helpful support!",4,Great app with a bit of a learning curve for beginners
141,"Although I grew up swimming in a pool, I have never swam for anything other than leisure. Due to a bad back I decided I wanted to try and learn techniques of swimming laps. This app gave me a workout but not what any of it means. What’s an FR, KI, IM, DR, etc? It’s not broken down into real basics. This appears more for someone who swam on team at some point. I don’t know technique and there are not videos for all the strokes. Pretty disappointed with this app advertising to true beginners such as myself. The search continues....",2,Not for true beginners
142,"I used to swim without a plan, which I see is a huge mistake. Swimming with MySwimPro is fun, stimulating, challenging, and I learn a lot from the training videos. I have other swimmers using it now at the Y. Highly recommend. I want to swim when I am 94 so please stay in business.",5,This app is the best!
143,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,4,Needs more free features/workouts
144,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting. 

I love myswimpro!!!",5,Super awesome app

I'd rather pay for a set training regime because I don't need or use the whole catalog of workouts. There isn't a decent equivalent to the couch to 5k apps they have for running.",2,Not priced for the casual swimmer
159,"I’m a beginning swimmer and hoped to find some direction with the free trial before deciding if both swimming and this app are for me. But you have to subscribe for the free trial. That model really bothers me as it puts the burden on the user to cancel, rather than just locking the user out after 30 days. I won’t play that game. Oh well. App deleted.",3,Free Trial requires subscription
160,Has good features and workouts but if your walls are decent it will not track your distance correctly. From there it’s far to cumbersome to return to the app and correct the distance.,4,Needs improvement
161,"Fantastic swim (and now dry land) programmes, generally very easy to use. Swim programmes are varied and you feel and see the results quickly. The dry land ones are like having a PT! 
Also, they’re very approachable, and fix any issues super quickly. Highly recommend.",5,Fantastic
162,"I uninstalled last year because it stopped recording without warning. Decided to give it another try. It was really sweet for 2 workouts, and now it’s back to not recording again.",5,Stops recording randomly
163,"Let’s finish the hassle to find a coach.. 
The Science is here behind this app..
All you need to know about your progression in swimming like: laps, heart rate, stroke per lap, swolf score, meters, calories, etc..
This app will help you achieve your goals in no time.",5,Progression in no time
164,"Never could I believe that at my age I would be a good swimmer and enjoy it. And doing 1500
Yards every other day. Thank you MySwimPro.

Still going strong and enjoying my swimming. Getting strong I am getting better. I’m seventy two years feel like 60 or better. Thanks MySwimPro.",5,Beyond me.
165,"I downloaded the app to track my swimming, didn’t know it’d cost a monthly fee around $20. Had I known that I wouldn’t have downloaded the app. I feel like it should’ve been in the app description so I’d know not to download it. 

On top of that I have to get their stupid spam every few weeks. I tried to unsubscribe but I still get it and I never asked for it.",3,Hell no
166,"I had high hopes for this app , but i was very disappointed. I signed up for a trial period, the app doesn’t work well with my watch and doesn’t deliver as promised so I cancelled the premium membership before trial expired. They charged my card regardless. There’s no way to get on touch with support , although I tried several times . They keep trying to charge my card every 2 days. I would love to hear back from MySwimPro and have this issue sorted out .",1,Keeps trying to charge
167,"I really like the app, however after the first few times of it working perfectly, I am no longer able to end my workout.  It doesn’t crash like other reviews said, but it is still frustrating.  I now manually enter the workout on my iPhone.  It was better when I didn’t have to do that.",3,Used to work great!
168,"I loved this app. Then it broke a couple of weeks ago.

But as of today, this latest update is AMAZING! 

Thanks for adding the visual refresh and fixing the buttons bugs. Really. This is great!",5,Holy smokes with the latest update!
169,"I had a problem syndicate workouts with my Fitbit Ionic. I contacted Fares via WhatsApp and reached out to me directly And assigned one of his team to call me, in Poland no less. My problem was solved and Fares demonstrated that the art of customer service is not lost.",5,The Art of Customer Service is Not Lost
170,"Loved the app until about two weeks ago. Now, all you can do is look at multiple offers to subscribe. It’s now so laggy I can’t even see previous swims, any given swim split times, or my accomplishments. It just stops responding. 

When it works right it’s “*****” (five stars). 

PLEASE FIX IT!",3,Used to be excellent
171,"When skipping intervals (for example the interval is 5mins but you finished in 4 and want to get to the next set), the app has a tendency to either freeze on the timer or just end the workout and not save any of your workout. DO NOT USE THIS APP UNTIL ITS FIXED. It has been going on the past month including my workout this morning after their latest update two days ago.",1,Bug will dump your workouts
172,"Quite a few good features but unless you are swimming nearly every day there’s almost no way to take advantage of most of them. If you decide to quit, good luck trying to cancel your subscription. The manage subscription function on both the app and the website won’t let you login no matter what browser you use.",2,App overpromises; cancellation is difficult
173,"This app used to be wonderful- it would let you track workouts through time, record your PRs, etc. If you wanted, you could pay for workout suggestions and coaching. Now you must pay an absurd fee for everything- even logging your own workouts. A monthly subscription costs as much as my pool fee- and that’s just to track workouts!",1,This app costs as much per month as my pool fee
174,"Needs tons of bug fixes.  Not sure why anybody would pay or join, when you can’t change any of your workouts.  It only sets the workouts by some computer program, nothing the swimmer may want.  You can’t save any changes, very frustrating.",2,Sometimes works less than half the time
175,"I’ve been using the MSP app about a month and love it. Workouts are easy to follow and have helped improve my swim.  I also have had quick response when asking questions or needing advice.  Overall, great app.",5,Great App and support
176,"Used to be able to write my own workouts and save up to 5 at a time. Now it won’t even let me write my own workouts without paying a high amount. 

If you want the coaching and the workouts, then this app can be great. However, I have workouts from my coach and used the app to write my workouts and keep me on pace. Now that I can no longer do this, I have no use for this app.",1,Bad update
177,I love the app but have to print out workouts to use with my garmin because when I use the watch to train it adds hundreds of yards to my swim. The workouts are great but hope the bug gets fixed.,5,Love the app
178,"I spent over 10 minutes filling out all of the information just to come to the screen where you have to actually make a purchase. That is horrible practice for any company that is on the App Store. It should be way more obvious.  

Shame on you and your company. I was really looking forward to this app but I’m not even going to bother. I will find something else.

Boooooooo 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼",1,Hidden fees!!!
179,"I downloaded this app so that I could find a good swim set for a few beginner swimmers to swim in order to prepare for being at sea for a week. I was instantly disappointed to find that the only way to use both the pre-made sets and the monthly plans was to pay $180 bucks a year to use the apps premium function, which is outrageous for the quality of the product you get. Very disappointed!",1,Awful App!  Not what is advertised!
180,This thing is like being on dial up in 2001. I love it but I hate how it stalls and is so slow when I add my own workouts in. I updated and have all the new features but it’s still so friggin slow when I save my workout or tap on share. iPhone 8 Plus user.,4,Love the app... BUT
181,Great App. I synch it up with my Apple Watch and it delivers my workout set by set. There is always a workout of the day (WOD) and if that does not work for you there are plenty of others to choose from. Upgraded to Elite after a month of using the free App. Worth every penny!,4,Best swimming app
182,"I thought there would be short videos and information for all levels of swimmers. Instead, there’s videos that you can’t watch unless you have a subscription, and short articles that take you to their website. This app is useless unless you pay to upgrade it by subscription.",1,Nothing available
183,"Way too expensive. The free version is so limited it nearly worthless. Need a $5 one time purchase version with ability to create more than 5 workouts. I found the training plans did not fit my pace so I had to modify all of them, eliminating the time savings of not having to enter it myself. 

Also, it seems to monitor my yards accurately in a 25 yard pool but is way off in a 50m pool (as much as 500 yards in a 2,000m workout)",1,$100 per year!
184,"I have accessibility issues, and swimming is one place where I don’t feel handicapped. This app changed that for the worst. If you have problems with small movements or joint issues in your hands, I advise choosing another app. I couldn’t shut it off when my swim was done. Even after drying off and physically taking the watch off, I had to remove the app from my phone to turn stop my workout!",1,Not Accessible!
185,I enjoy learning all the new techniques to swim longer and stronger. I am a long time swimmer but have gotten away from it for years. Enjoy the community here within the swim pro app.,5,Swimmer
186,It seems like a really good app for either open water workouts or pool workouts but whenever I tried to find a workout that was right for me it was locked and told me I had to upgrade. I would be OK with paying $5 a month but the subscription was $12 a month!!! Personally I thought it was not worth it and there are plenty of cheaper alternatives.,1,Expensive
187,"I downloaded this app as a never before swimmer to see how it worked. I am familiar with auto renew for apps. However, this app auto renews without “warning your free trial is up” alert that I have always gotten with other apps.   I had planned to pay for a month once the period was up to see if
I found the app useful. However, the app auto renewed for a full year, and my requests to auto renew at a monthly rate was denied.",1,Beware of auto renew.
188,"When you pause the workout on the Apple Watch, it won’t resume no matter what buttons I try. I have to end my workout and restart, which makes it difficult to accurately track",4,Great app; One problem
189,"Yes, the app is expensive, but it has tremendous value for those that struggle to stay motivated with workouts. I like the variety in swimming and dry land workouts as I work to stay healthy.",5,Worth it!
190,"I really like the new format. The workouts are great and I like how you can adjust distances, times, number of reps, and save the workouts. It is much more functional.",5,New Format
191,"Great app, except you have to pay for all the workouts and whenever I go to the community page it bugs out and sends me to the home page",4,Good app
192,Integrated well with Strava on Apple Watch 4. It’s the only solution I could find for that purpose. Also recorded very accurately and the staff were helpful as I tried to configure things.,5,Works with Strava and Apple Watch 4
193,Not sure how I lived without MSP. I feel like I have my own personal coach. Workouts are great and engaging. Videos are helpful for someone like me. Love my swim log!!! Highly recommend to all my fishy friends.,5,No more guessing how long a lap takes :)
194,"This app is really helpful, whether I want a structured workout or just want it to log my swim in the pool. The information it provides after a swim is really great.",5,So helpful!
195,"The actual app is good enough, but as of now, it looks like the technique videos aren’t loading on iOS. This is a shame, because those instructional videos are the primary reason I bought a membership. Hope this gets fixed soon before I cancel the free trial.",2,Needs an update
196,I have tried many trackers and swim focused plans. This is the best by far to keep you disciplined and help follow very well thought out work out plans .,5,The best app to get you to the next level
197,"So inconvenient when you want to be accurate on your activity tracker, when I saved the workout to upload it to my Apple Watch, automatically recorded as if already done it, and I didn’t! Now my activity for the day recorded the workout without swimming! The worst part is that I can’t erase it ones it’s done.",2,Register in iWatch activity without workout
198,"Pretty good at tracking my workouts, however I get tons of notifications for workouts that are completed by people I don’t know and I don’t follow. There doesn’t seem to be a way to turn those notifications off.",3,Problem with notifications.
199,"I used this to basically relearn to swim as an adult and it’s turned me into a consistent lap swimmer. I can’t recommend it enough, especially now they dry and wet programs are integrated.",5,It’s great
200,Love this app.  Worth the money. I download workouts to my Garmin and do whatever it says. Improved my fitness and helped me when doctors told me to swim more and run less.,5,Makes swimming fun and challenging
201,"I like the app very much. I was having trouble opening the app on my Apple Watch. I  emailed the support team and received a quick response and a fix. 
Thank you!!!",5,Excellent support!! Excellent app!!!
202,Loved using the app to track practices and it showed my progress throughout the season! Every swimmer should have this app,5,Definitely Recommend
203,It was alright until this update.  It has crashed 3 times in 2 days in the middle of my workouts.  It’s frustrating when you are 75% done with your workout and it stops and erases your progress.  I think I’ll just go back to doing it old school.  At least laminated paper doesn’t crash.,1,Keeps crashing
204,"I understand subscribing for personalized and updated content, but now My Swim Pro won’t even let you create your OWN workout without paying $30 per month. I’d be willing to buy the base level app (manually create and log workouts). The free version isn’t even as good the native Workouts app for Apple Watch!",1,Demands Subscription for Anything Useful
205,Hi swim pro I really like swim pro because I love swimming and I have been swimming since I was 1 years of old and so me day I want to work with dolphins and swim with them           Sincerely Rebekah,5,Why I like swim pro
206,It is rare to see an app where tech support responds to users directly. The latest updates are awesome and super user friendly.,5,Terrific support
207,There’s simply nothing like it. I started using it early 2020 and it is truly a powerful tool for swimmers. Allows me to follow a plan with real time motivation and accountability. Real fun and well done.,5,The best swimming app in the market
208,"I use this app to help me count my calories, distance and my exercise as I swim! It helps me when other apps cannot!",5,I use this app for…
209,"The entire app is a subscription you have to pay for. Dont you guys think you should have a hand full of workouts that are free so the user can determine if they like it or not?

I cant give the app a chance and i’m obviously not paying $20 for something I dont know if I want. I genuinely don’t get how this became so famous",2,I don’t get it...
210,"This app did not work well.  I have an iphone 7+ and tried using it this morning.  After my swim, i saved my workout on my watch only because my phone was not nearby.  Two hours later, i cant find the workout, nor can i upload it to the app on my phone.  This app is not so refined, nor is it intuitive.  Hopefully a developer comes up with abetter one.",1,Doesnt work
211,I really like what this app has the possibility of doing but unfortunately it’s not there yet. Still has problems stopping app on Apple Watch and doesn’t accurately calculate distance in open swims. Really difficult to stop app and close so information is sent to exercise app.,3,Open swim!
212,Loved the stats and the workouts available but has anyone else had an issue of the app not being able to close? When I was done swimming I went to hit finish and it wouldn’t let me. Ended up closing it out but it would keep reopening. Had to delete it eventually just so the app would stop.,2,Seemed alright
213,All it does is provide an ad for the subscription services the offer. Click on anything within the app and you get an ad to upgrade to Pro. The worst kind of app there is. Extremely annoying and there is no option to turn it off. Yet it’s the only swim tracker that the Apple Watch supports.,1,Terrible App
214,"MySwimPro has helped me gain a significant insight into my swimming! A great swim tracking app that can be used by all swimmers. Using this app, I got great workouts daily to improve my speed in all four strokes!",5,The best app for swimmers!
215,"You no longer get basic stats like heart rate without paying a hefty subscription. Might be worth paying for if you’re a competitive swimmer but if you’re just using it to exercise, to lose weight, it’s just too much. I already have subscription fatigue. This is just too much.",1,Basic features need subscription
216,"I’d try it again but 15$ a month!?
Hopefully, Apple will further develop their own app.",5,Was initially excited but crashed far too often
217,So I have been using this terrible app for the past year. It is basically worthless. I used to pretend that the logged swims were accurate because I was so ready to support this app.  After a year of completely inaccurate results  with no improvement I’ve decided that this review was necessary.  I’m very critical because I am software rengineer and I wold be ashamed to release such a piece of garbage.,1,Worst app ever
218,Unless you pay for the subscription which I can’t afford as it’s way to pricy you can’t do anything in the app. There are claims you get 5 workouts but every workout is locked it’s a huge scam. I don’t care how helpful it could be putting everything behind a paywall despite what is promised in the free use of the app is a scam.,1,Not useful
219,"The app is a pretty good coach, but in terms of tracking swimming when paired with a Fitbit Versa and an iPhone 8.... it’s garbage.

Don’t bother.

Even tried the advanced “up-sell”, still nothing.
———-
Update: Based on Reading over reviews, it seems like this company is more interested in appearing helpful than actually making a product that functions properly.

Do you know how much money and employees they must dedicate to troubleshoooting? Have you ever seen another review where the developer has tried so hard (with robot responses) to seem like they care.

It all makes sense.

Garbage app that should be removed from the APP store!",1,Does not work
220,"I’ve updated my review, the developers worked to figure out what was causing the iWatch app to crash during my swim, and suggested a temp fix I could use until the update js published.  Great team, functional app, likes this.",4,Great idea
221,Great swim workouts and great tracking. MySwimPro would be outstanding if it included a web-based interface that allowed users to use all of its features on a larger format.,4,"Love all of it, but ..."
222,"I really want to like it but the constant pop ups about buying a $170 annual subscription are a nuisance. 

In addition the program is slow to respond and the screen freezes up.",2,Has potential || too many bugs
223,"This guy videos are great and it seems like the app has a lot to offer, but the free version has nothing of it! 

Nothing at all! There’s a free trail but that’s not good enough as you have to add your credit card info…

The yearly price is very overpriced, there should be a single payment that unlocks the app not a subscription!! Ripp off!",1,Nothing good in free version
224,"If your subscription expires, all data you paid for previous period is also hidden immediately. 
So, even no history for you if do not continue to pay.",2,Data taken away
225,"Does not load work-outs. Repeated crashes (despite of the app being deleted and then reinstalled). I definitely would NOT recommend this app, and more importantly I would not pay a cent for this piece of garbage! Anyone who makes the mistake of buying this scam app exposes themselves to being ripped off like I was.",1,Worthless App
226,This is a great app- as a long distance open water swimmer the workout and dry land have been instrumental in directing and planning my workouts. Very worthwhile.,5,Awesome App
227,Workouts won’t load. Sent an email they were able to add it for me. I was grinding for two weeks really enjoying it. Now I open up the app to find it added a different program and erased all the numbers and times I’ve added. 🤷🏽‍♂️ found a different workout app with no bugs  save your self the headache,1,Workouts don’t load
228,"I am a 10 year old swimmer and Im not too sure about how to use it but just seeing a swimming app brightens up my day,(I also have a swim meet on March 13 so good luck to me).",5,Awesome
229,"Since the most recent update the heart rate data from my workouts no longer syncs to strava. Please fix, thanks. Otherwise great app!",4,Strava sync messed up in recent update
230,They’ve been trying to charge my card for two weeks now after I’ve cancelled everything and contacted them to ask them to stop running the card. I have no current subscriptions but they don’t seem to care. They just want money.,1,Money hungry
231,"It’s an amazing app, I started using this app 3 weeks ago and every time I open it I feel so motivated",5,Highly recommended
232,"Not only it measured laps in my watch while I wasn't even moving (!), it completely drained my Apple Watch faster then anything I ever saw, and now my watch won't even start (green snake of death)!

I hope this app will be removed from the App Store till those problems that can really harm your watch be fixed!",1,I hope I never saw this app or installed it
233,I like having my workout on my watch,5,Fantastic for swim tracking
234,If everything did not cost something then this app would probably be awesome. But unless you pay you don’t have access to anything. I’ve been a swimmer for who knows how long and I would rather just watch a video on line than get this.,2,Too pricy
235,I love the app but would really like to see a taper function that can be utilized for competitions.,5,Needs one more thing
236,Still using and loving the app! Love the updates and new features. Thank you guys for the best swim app ever!,5,Update
237,App has great potential only if you’re willing to pay $30 per month.  I’m not planning on being an Olympian so I find it hard to justify. I’ll use the $30 to buy 7-8 gallons of gas each month.,2,Just enough to lure you
238,I love this app. I use it primarily to log my time & distance each morning. I gives me fun milestones as I go greater distances.,5,Great swim tracker
239,"I subscribed for a full year at their outrageous rate, but found the app nearly featureless for my open water swimming. As I look around the app, nothing here justifies a $4.99/week price. Zilch! Absurd pricing.

Once I found the swim dot com app I loaded that on to my Apple Watch and never looked backz",1,Not worth it at a third the cost
240,Best swim app hands down. Most detailed and most immediate support for any level.,5,Look no more
241,"The app is a great concept, but it is extremely buggy and will often delete parts of sets I have made. The subscription is great, but is extremely expensive and you would get more out of a masters or club team. Don’t waste your money.",2,Not worth it
242,"It won’t open with my Apple Watch.  When i tried to set up an account on my watch , it kept telling me to enter a valid email.  Uh- that was a valid email.  Not worth the hassle. It even tells you open up your app to use with the watch... ya speak work either.  I’ll find something else.",1,Too many issues
243,"If you have the motivation to sweat and take action, this app helps you take action smartly.",5,Consistency and Commitment
244,"I have been waiting for you to add Garmin support. Unfortunately, it is not logging my work out very well. I do enjoy the videos, and the workouts, but for the app to add real value that has to properly capture my swimming.",2,"Thank you for the Garmin support, but it doesn’t work very well"
245,Almost all workouts require a subscription.  29/month or 179/year.  Everything free is tracking and the community. I didn’t click through on the community link so I don’t know how far in you go without a subscription.,1,Useless without subscription
246,Using the app for almost 2 years. Really enjoy seeing my improvement  on a daily basis,5,Great app
247,"This app allows you to download it for free but everything I’ve checked out is a paid feature. 

It looks legit, and if I paid for it, I’m sure I’d improve, but at least give something for free, and no not a 7 day trial that will charge me at the end(I know a can cancel right when I start the trail to not pay).",1,Not free whatsoever.
248,"The app itself is great, I love how easy it is to make programs, however when I try to load a program on my Fitbit Versa it says “connection error” I have tried uninstalling the app, but nothing seems to work regardless of what I’m doing.",2,Can’t get it to work on my Fitbit versa
249,I subscribed for a year on the website and in the app I still have an ad asking me to subscribe take up 50% of the entire screen - and it scrolls with the screen ruining the app - it’s just insane,1,Even after subscribing an add to subscribe takes up 50% of the screen
250,"The amount of functionality that’s locked behind a subscription is pretty out of control. At the very least, I expect to be able to structure my own workouts, without being able to tap into guided workouts and coaching.",1,Paywall overkill
251,Worked great at first.  Now I experience connection and tracking problems all the time.  It will just cut off in the middle of my swim and not log it.  During free swim will not log the distance at all.  Today swam 825 meters it logged 275 meters.  Very disappointed.,2,Connection Problems
252,This free version is worthless. There is nothing there. I don’t mind if you want me to purchase more but don’t pretend you are giving me something. I’m so disgusted with your worthless free version I refuse to buy from you. On top of that $15/ month is ridiculous too. Now I just want to tell other swimmers not to support such nonsense.,1,Don’t bother
253,I’ve been using this app for a couple of years now and find it’s not accurate in recording distance (always short) and lately there has been trouble transferring my swim workouts to my account.  I using an Apple II watch and iPhone7.,1,Missing the Mark with Performance

255,"The app it is the best around for swimming but the app freeze each time I try to log or just watched the work out. Even I am not a free member. It is not randomly it happens 100%. 
Sometimes during the work out it also freeze, now this issue does happen now and then. 

But over all it is good and it is the best out there. 

Hopefully they will fix this little issues I am experincing with it. 

Enjoy",3,Good app but need to be polish
256,I purchased the app in full for a year . It’s expensive so I didn’t expect difficulty. The videos don’t play immediately. Also the graphics overlap on my programs,3,Video issue
257,I went on this app thinking there would be many workouts and I could actually do things! But no. I have to get an elite membership just so I can unlock the workouts I actually want to do. I do NOT recommend this app to anyone who actually wants to swim and workout.,1,Terrible. Way too expensive👎
258,"You can’t do anything with this app unless you pay for elite. I can basically log a workout and that’s it. I can’t watch any of the videos or get a set to help me structure a workout, not worth it unless you wanna pay for it!",2,Can’t do anything
259,Very misleading on the App Store. Appears to have a free version with some limited features but really has nothing at all. Would not even show me all the workouts that I manually inputted and logged. I don’t mind pay apps but don’t appreciate being deceived into a useless download.,1,Misleading - no free features
260,Awesome app.  Very user friendly and reliable.  I use it six days a week with the Apple Watch.,5,Outstanding swim app.
261,I was so excited to get the app and my new waterproof case from catalyst... well it won’t even let me start the workout and displays a warning... okay I have a waterproof case I’m not stupid... but the app doesn’t work!!! Really????,2,Doesn’t work with series 1 and waterproof case???
262,I used to love this app. I don’t know what happened. I took a break from swimming and when I came back it won’t track laps. Twice I hit start and after swimming several laps I looked at my watch and it was as if I never hit start.,1,Won’t track
263,"Really great app in theory, but has a lot of bugs. I have some workouts that I started to check the interface out but didn’t actually do, but I can’t seem to delete them???",2,App doesn’t let me delete workouts
264,What an amazing app to track my swim workouts! Definitely motivates me to do more and keep getting better!,5,Awesome swim app!
265,"This has some incredible stuff, and has the potential to be great. The structured workouts with vibration technology are really cool. But the stats and splits are so BAD it’s terrible. If you have a garmin and the stats are deal breaker for you….DO NOT BUY.",2,Good but bad
266,"I already paid the yearly subscription, I hope I won’t get charge 2 times",2,Not sure it asked me to buy again for the subscription
267,"The app used to let you do more with the Free version, but now everything is behind a paywall. You can’t even create a workout without a subscription. Definitely not worth.",1,Advertisement for Paid version
268,"Everything you click on brings you to a page to sign-up for “elite” membership (at $180/year!). No information or help is free, just a link back to that page. What a let down!",1,So annoying!
269,Easiest way to keep up with laps and stats One found yet. SO SIMPLE to use and follow!,5,Best App for Swimmers
270,The app is wonderful if you’re willing to dish out about 200 bucks a year. That’s more than my gym membership.. it’s unfortunate that there is no middle ground. Like a low rate to create your own workouts. Its free or $200 bucks. Where’s the middle ground?,1,Greedy Subscription Rate
271,I just know this app is amazing and that if it does work it would be fantastic. The problem is that it doesnt. I cant seem to open any of the training plans. Hopefully they fix this so I can give it a 4-5 star.,1,I know this app is great but…
272,"Often buggy: delayed logging, missed logging after start, eyc. Can't rely on it to Just Work. Strong customer service but need to focus more on the app testing and reliability.",2,iOS version seems buggy

301,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",3,Bummer.

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",3,Mixed Feelings
367,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",5,Most Helpful App for Swimming
368,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",5,Best way to record & improve my swimming
369,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",5,Best swimming app I've tried
370,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",5,HUGE Help!!!
371,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",4,"Great App, just needs something more."
372,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",4,Love it!
373,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",4,Great App for unaffiliated swimmers
374,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it's totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!",5,Changed the way I swim
375,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",5,Solid app
376,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout.

377,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance.

378,"When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything. I love using this app as it tracks my swimming but, the update has made it stressful and annoying.",3,Loved the app...until update.
379,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming. I love that I can track my progress, pick from a variety of sets, and customize my workouts to my ability.  The videos are helpful, especially for those just getting into swimming.  The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",5,Love this!

486,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",2,Needs Work
487,This app is cool.,5,Amazing
488,THIS APP IS DOPE!,5,Dope app
489,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,1,Dr
490,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",2,Very limited app
491,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",1,lost workout - difficulty creating custom workouts
492,"This app finally got me back in the pool, after a ten-year hiatus. The workouts are interesting, go by quickly, and I’m so pleased to see real progress. When I was trying to swim without it, I was doing maybe 1000-1500k but I’m back at 3-4K workouts, like I did in high school. Just did my first dryland workout and I like the format of that, too! I recommend it to all the swimmers in my life :)",5,So worth it :)
493,would most likely be a good app except for the fact that you can't do anything without a subscription im 14 years old and don't have $179.99 to spen in an app all i need to use is the dryland again seems like a really good app and has really good customer service but it's not for me (sorry if i offended anyone with this review),3,It's a no for me
494,"I started swimming 4 years ago at the age of 50 and stumbled upon this app through the YouTube videos that taught me how to swim. For 2+ years I put off paying the “extra” money for the coaching and other features available. Now that I did purchase the coaching, I have ZERO regrets. My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",5,Incredible App and Support
495,"Apple Watch Swim mode doesn’t  track kick drills. MySwimPro does.  It even reminds you if you forgot to switch into drill mode, (GPS😵‍💫). Also, be careful pairing with Strava on Apple Watch. It’ll record the same workout twice.",5,Revised  10/7/21
496,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",2,MySwimPro by MyProgrammingAmateur

507,"Do not get this app!  It will work for a while and then refuse to load new workouts to your Apple Watch.  Very discounting for an app that costs $25 a month.  You might as well use the swim.com app, which is cheaper and works.",1,Very Buggy and Incredibly Disapointing
508,"I've used this app 3 times and all 3 times I got inaccurate lap counts. Seems to be way off the count by 800-900 yards. I usually swim 3500 to 4000 yards and it will only count 2600-3100 .. that's a big difference. And yes I'm doing all the right things .. not stopping in middle of my
Laps, I make sure I have a good turn and push off. This morning I was finishing up a 3500 yard swim .. my lap count was 2600... I was doing my 100 yard cool down.. when I reached the end of my laps .. I noticed the app had crashed and I lost totally lost my swim.. needless to say I'm going to delete this app. Worthless!",5,Dissatisfied
509,I downloaded the app to see if I could use it to start swimming for recreation. I didn’t like the set up or the workouts so I canceled the trial subscription. 14 days later I get hit with a charge of $109.00 for the year log subscription!,1,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE APP AND THEN CANCEL!!!!
510,App is useless. Cant even log in using email. Keep getting username/ password error. Customer service is horrible. Can log in website but that does me no good. What a waste!,1,Disappointing
511,"The worst,it is ten dollars a month just to unlock one stroke and that one stroke has one type of swim! A 1,000 it gives you a 500 freestyle to start off with.don't get it it takes forever to download and it is a waste even buying the pro version. So mad!!! 😡😡😡😡😡",1,Horrible
