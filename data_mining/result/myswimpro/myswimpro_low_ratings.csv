5,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",2,Complicated
9,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",3,I bet it works great with Apple watches…
11,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",3,Great idea w/ ok execution. Buyer beware
13,"I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  
Please respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.  Remember if it’s not broken why do u have to mess with it!",1,What is going on?
17,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",1,"Works well when it does, but when it doesn’t..."
18,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",2,Doesn’t track basic laps
19,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",1,False Advertising
22,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",2,Once crash too many
24,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",1,Horrible
26,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",3,Stop telling me about all your upgrades
27,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",2,The 4 and 5 star reviews are wrong
31,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",3,Watch metrics not accurate
34,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",1,No longer worth it
36,"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",3,"Good app, but way overpriced"
37,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",2,Not Worth It
38,"For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.",1,"Janky app, terrible workouts"
39,"I went to the pool today and planned on using my watch and Swim Pro! Nope, I was greeted with tiny print telling me, nah, this app requires me to get permission! I’m sitting with my legs in the water and ready to start laps and no the app is NOT going to track my laps. And it didn’t. Useless! I paid for an app for swimming and it refused to work. If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry. I pay to swim and paid for an app. Useless!
I have been to the pool 3 times with this app. Nothing works. Garbage. 
There needs to be instructions on setting it up and using it. Instead, it wants to sell upgrades. I hate it!",1,Cumbersome to use
41,"When I signed up and filled in my profile info there was a workout.  Paid my subscription fee and went to pool. When I opened app there was a confusing amount of info and the workout included dryland etc. My profile did not include dryland, and it did include my available workout time.   The workout I saw before subscription was good. After I paid … totally different and I’m not able to stop and fiddle on my phone in the bright sun.  I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.  Very disappointed and wishing I didn’t spend money on this nonsense.",1,Confusing and costly
42,"Used the app with my Garmin Fenix 5S pro today for the first time. Already seeing the bugs that previous reviewers have mentioned. Even though my settings across Garmin, this app, and my watch are all set to yards and miles, it kept switching back-and-forth between meters and yards and then it was short changing me on the yards. It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash. I like the idea of workouts but this is going to drive me nuts and not sure I’m willing to pay for something that doesn’t work properly.",2,Can you make this sync properly with Garmin?
45,My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.,1,Freezes on Apple Watch
49,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

tl;dr. this app is only for swimmers who are primarily concerned with lap times and who don’t have a team and are willing to pay for a pretty expensive app.",1,"no value to free version, paid is too expensive"
51,"I’m done with this app. Don’t get me wrong this app is great and I’ve loved using it as I’ve gotten back into swimming. However somehow I got logged out of my account and couldn’t remember the password I used when I first set up the app. I’ve requested several password resets over the course of a week and have not received one in my inbox, spam, or junk folders. I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.",1,Poor customer support
53,"First off I’m just starting off swimming and have used the app once with my watch and it seems to have done what I was hoping it would do.  I’m not a sophisticated swimmer so I can’t comment on all the analytics etc. 

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. 

Well you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.",2,Frustrating Subscription Options
55,"Meh. It’s ok. Downloaded it for the drill/kick set mode. That part is fine. I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements). Lots of great potential here but a lot to be desired…maybe in time it’ll improve. At least I didn’t spend money on it.",3,Meh. Ok. Lots of room for improvement
56,"Recently got a series 3 AppleWatch and was looking for a good swim workout app. Most of the reviews were positive for MSP so I thought I’d give it a shot. Prior to the recent update it was great, I’m not a pro swimmer so the basic features do just fine. Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming. I cleared the cache on my phone & watch, restarted the watch and it still doesn’t work right. I would have given it a higher mark because I like the app but it is now broken & virtually unusable to me...",2,Recent Update Issues
59,"Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",1,Crashed and nothing logged
62,"I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",2,Great until yesterday
64,"I took me a really long time to just log a swim workout just now and every time I clicked “save” to add a set, pops up their ad to subscribe monthly or annually, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",2,"Great App, updates are too much"
66,"Up until this summer, I was able to create a simple workout and that was good for me - I know my times, I’m not looking to win medals or meets, but just wanted something that tracks workouts and tells me when to push off the wall. Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable. Even if they’d have offered an inexpensive option to just make your own workouts, I could be on board, but this isn’t worth the hassle.",1,"Free version is useless, borderline false advertising"
67,"UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$. 

DON’T waste your time or money. Try other apps.",1,Don’t waste your time or $$
68,"After using for approx 3 months, 2-3 times a week I have to say, I am not happy. Around 40-45 minutes into any workout, randomly the watch app closes. And it’s not every time. Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank. Which means it didn’t record over to Strava or my health app on Apple. Overall I like it, which is why it got 3. But it is very frustrating to find the app closed after a workout is not quite done.",3,Random Shuts Down
69,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",2,"Fiddly, Naggy and Tracks Poorly"
71,"I couldn’t tell what I was supposed to do because it was too confusing. I paid for the full membership around 7 months ago, and I’m supposed to have quarterly 1:1 with a coach to help me, but aside from the first meet (which I didn’t know was video chat with the owner, my “coach” and some other guy), I’ve not received any kind of contact since. And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming. I genuinely wish I hadn’t paid for it, but I definitely cancelled my subscription so I’m not charged again.",1,What even is it
73,"My workout plan doesn’t sync with Apple watch at all. Workout often doesn’t register in the app. I’ve tried all of the steps recommended to remedy these bugs to no avail. It work seamlessly about four or five updates ago. I wish I could back. Even more disappointing give the coming price increase. As helpful as it is, a clunky app isnt worth a $1000 lifetime subscription. The yearly price increase (not yet announced) may be too steep without improvement in performance of the app.",3,much more buggy since most recent updates
79,"I'm sure this app does a lot of great things but I only wanted to use the free version to log my own workouts using the Quick Log feature. But after logging my first workout the app will no longer easily let me change the minutes (duration) of my swim--it takes 10+ tries to change the time, if it works at all. It's frustrating and hard to gauge my pace without an accurate time. Any fix for this? I do like that it connects to Strava.",3,Can't set minutes in Quick Log feature
82,"I’m not one to write reviews, but I felt that this was important for those looking for a swim app. There are no free workouts at all, and when I tried to create a workout, I couldn’t find it again in the morning. It was very upsetting for me that EVERYTHING, from technique videos to training plans, all required payment to continue. As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee. Very disappointed.",1,There is NO FREE TRAINING MATERIAL
88,"I wanted to try this app out because it had great reviews and others I know use it. The signup process was tedious, the amount of emails I have received already is overwhelming, and when I tried to watch some videos through the iOS and iPadOS app, the video would try to launch, but then it would close the video immediately after trying to watch.

It was enough of a bad experience within the first 5 minutes to turn me away given the high price tag. I would hope that this money would be put to good use developing a high quality app that works.",1,First Impression was not good
89,I got this app so I can customize my workouts and swim at my own pace. After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.  I suggest you create an option where the user can only customize their workouts and log their workouts. All the other stuff on there I don’t even look at.,2,So disappointed
90,"The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. 

This behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. 

It’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.",2,Too frustrating to recommend
91,I found the description to be a bit misleading for a free app. Yes the app is free but there is nothing you can do with out the paid subscription. I’m training for a triathlon and wanted a good resource to help with swimming workouts but the 7 day trial isn’t a long enough evaluation period for me to see if I want to spend $20/month on an subscription. I can track swimming on my Apple Watch so I don’t need the app without the premium features at all.  I thought that was a too costly considering I can’t tell what I would really be getting since everything is locked down. No thanks.,2,Subscription Required
96,"I’m a swimmer on a team who likes to track down what we do every day. We swim about 2 times a day for 6 days a week and whenever I try recording my times from meets, it doesn’t even record down the time and I have to do it all over again. It’s very buggy and it’s split recording isn’t good. The good part about this app is that it makes it easier to record our practices and times but however, with these problems it makes it nearly impossible to.",3,It’s a good app but has some problems
98,"Been using for years and used to like it a lot. I understand the developers have to make money, but these days it’s quite annoying to use this app if you don’t need any to sign up for one of their paid subscriptions. It’s constantly barraging you to subscribe, make a training plain, etc. 

If you want to use this app as your coach it’s probably a good one. But if you just want to track your swimming activity, there are probably better options now.",2,Only worth if you have a paid subscription
102,Having to unlock the watch just to switch the reps is very difficult because there is water on the watch and that messes with the screen heavily. Only way it’s possible is to dry your hands and the watch every time. My suggest is being able to double click the crown button or side button to switch reps. I think this is a pretty big pit fall which is why I gave 3 stars. Otherwise it’s a great app.,3,Switching reps is less than ideal
107,"This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

* Initially Garmin sync would reset itself every time I entered “Account Settings”. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get that working as expected.

It’s a real pity as pool swimming can be quite monotonous without a coaching aspect.",1,Shady trial structure and Garmin 735 issues
108,"I have been using the app since it was launched. Today I use it to measure pace, etc. I utilize the sync/import my workouts feature for the most part. However since the last couple of updates, they have come through broken. My 200s come through as 25s, 75s…even though when I look at them in the iOS Fitness app they are tracking together. Please take a look. Thx",3,Please fix swim import feature
110,"It is a good app with good plans. I use it most every day. The biggest issue is it doesn’t work with high end Garmin watches to export swim plans although it sells this as a feature. I have the MK1 and integrating between the app and devices is so complicated and never works. Even their customer service team could t figure it out.  

This also isn’t a product for people on a budget. You can find so many free workouts online. So it’s good but could be great. Just do your research.",2,Poor Integration for Garmin Swimming
112,"I have a Garmin watch and I can’t see any benefits of using the free app, the info appears to be about the same you get for free with your watch app. It seems the Apple Watch features are great for doing workouts in the pool. However, there are no free workouts, everything has to be paid for, even stuff that is free on their website and the price is really ridiculous if you just want the workouts. May be worth it if there is actually a proper coaching strategy but not sure that’s the case, didn’t even go for their free trial. Deleted.",1,Only makes sense if you have an Apple Watch and lots of money
115,"I love all the features of this app and it truly is top notch. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is unreasonably high. I understand the amount of work and the excellence that went into this, but it doesn’t serve people who need an app like this that is reasonably affordable. I already pay a gym membership premium. Having this would be excellent for training, but would be like adding an additional gym membership to my budget. 
If the subscription is ever lowered substantially, count me in!",2,Great app! Too expensive
117,The workouts are not challenging or tailored to my performance—annoying since the app has spent nearly 2 years collecting my data. The videos and various workouts can all be found (better) on the internet. Hardly worth $119. You’ll also receive all sorts of emails and “training” videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they’re in a partnership with—like a $200 device to build lung capacity. This may be helpful for beginners but if you’re an intermediate or above swimmer it’s not worth the money.,2,Why bother
118,"I downloaded this app with high hopes. Unfortunately I encountered multiple issues right from the start, and eventually gave up and deleted it. 

After downloading the app to my phone and registering, I tried to open the app on my watch. It didn’t recognize that I had registered on my phone and wouldn’t move past the login screen. I had to restart my watch for it to log in. 

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. 

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout. 

3 restarts in the first 10 min of using the app. Don’t waste your time.",1,Don’t waste your time

I was automatically charged $100 after 7 days. I stopped using the app after the first swim, as it shuts off my Apple Watch ability to track data using Apple Health. I cannot find a customer support number anywhere, even though they promise their “premium” members ample support. More like endless links to wiki articles with no human in sight. Don’t make this mistake folks. This is a fraudulent app.",1,NO CUSTOMER SERVICE - Charged $100 for deleted app
122,"Getting to connect is difficult, and keeping connected even more. I have an Ionic, I loaded a workout last night, tried to use it this morning and it was fine, had to leave the pool to go get the phone to load it again. Then the app would not work because it the watch was not connected to the phone (had synchronized a minute before). Finally, I got the workout in, dis the workout and the data never made it to Fitbit dashboard. I also have an Apple Watch, I’m gonna test it with it, if it doesn’t work I’m deleting this app, so far not worth the money.",1,NOT for Fitbit
124,"The app looks great there are a lot of workout options and I liked the layout inside the workouts…when I could see it. Which brings me to why I’m giving it 3 stars, 99.9% of the app is behind a pay wall and it’s expensive. To pay for it on top of the gym membership to access the pool is not worth it. Especially since it doesn’t even sync with my smart watch (Fitbit).",3,Looks great but…

Not sure if it’s a bug with iOS9, a bug with low power mode for workouts, etc.   regardless I Had to go back to relying on another app :(.

Will be trying out some other apps or sticking with Apple watch’s swim tracker as advantages over a printed swim workout are minimal.",1,Buggy and overpriced
141,"Although I grew up swimming in a pool, I have never swam for anything other than leisure. Due to a bad back I decided I wanted to try and learn techniques of swimming laps. This app gave me a workout but not what any of it means. What’s an FR, KI, IM, DR, etc? It’s not broken down into real basics. This appears more for someone who swam on team at some point. I don’t know technique and there are not videos for all the strokes. Pretty disappointed with this app advertising to true beginners such as myself. The search continues....",2,Not for true beginners

251,Worked great at first.  Now I experience connection and tracking problems all the time.  It will just cut off in the middle of my swim and not log it.  During free swim will not log the distance at all.  Today swam 825 meters it logged 275 meters.  Very disappointed.,2,Connection Problems
252,This free version is worthless. There is nothing there. I don’t mind if you want me to purchase more but don’t pretend you are giving me something. I’m so disgusted with your worthless free version I refuse to buy from you. On top of that $15/ month is ridiculous too. Now I just want to tell other swimmers not to support such nonsense.,1,Don’t bother
253,I’ve been using this app for a couple of years now and find it’s not accurate in recording distance (always short) and lately there has been trouble transferring my swim workouts to my account.  I using an Apple II watch and iPhone7.,1,Missing the Mark with Performance
255,"The app it is the best around for swimming but the app freeze each time I try to log or just watched the work out. Even I am not a free member. It is not randomly it happens 100%. 
Sometimes during the work out it also freeze, now this issue does happen now and then. 

But over all it is good and it is the best out there. 

Hopefully they will fix this little issues I am experincing with it.

256,I purchased the app in full for a year . It’s expensive so I didn’t expect difficulty. The videos don’t play immediately. Also the graphics overlap on my programs,3,Video issue
257,I went on this app thinking there would be many workouts and I could actually do things! But no. I have to get an elite membership just so I can unlock the workouts I actually want to do. I do NOT recommend this app to anyone who actually wants to swim and workout.,1,Terrible. Way too expensive👎
258,"You can’t do anything with this app unless you pay for elite. I can basically log a workout and that’s it. I can’t watch any of the videos or get a set to help me structure a workout, not worth it unless you wanna pay for it!",2,Can’t do anything
259,Very misleading on the App Store. Appears to have a free version with some limited features but really has nothing at all. Would not even show me all the workouts that I manually inputted and logged. I don’t mind pay apps but don’t appreciate being deceived into a useless download.,1,Misleading - no free features
261,I was so excited to get the app and my new waterproof case from catalyst... well it won’t even let me start the workout and displays a warning... okay I have a waterproof case I’m not stupid... but the app doesn’t work!!! Really????,2,Doesn’t work with series 1 and waterproof case???
262,I used to love this app. I don’t know what happened. I took a break from swimming and when I came back it won’t track laps. Twice I hit start and after swimming several laps I looked at my watch and it was as if I never hit start.,1,Won’t track

271,I just know this app is amazing and that if it does work it would be fantastic. The problem is that it doesnt. I cant seem to open any of the training plans. Hopefully they fix this so I can give it a 4-5 star.,1,I know this app is great but…

299,As a newbie I just wanted to learn how to swim better and improve my technique. Looks like this app is more suited towards the hardcore swimmers because most features like workout and coaching require a $10/mo subscription.,1,Worthless without $10/mo subscription
300,"Apple Watch app not working - It won’t even open.

Update: app opens on watch. Going to try it out soon!",3,Watch
301,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",3,Bummer.

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",3,Mixed Feelings
378,"When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything. I love using this app as it tracks my swimming but, the update has made it stressful and annoying.",3,Loved the app...until update.
381,"I swim once a week. I'm a pool scrub, 800m and I'm toast. Working on getting better and looking for an app to help. This does with some videos and other training sundries. Unfortunately 80% of the app is behind a subscribe monthly wall which is far outside my appetite.

Also some bugs in editing swims. No matter what I edit. It saves the default program unless it is custom from the ground up. 

Good stats screen and glad to see something enter the arena but the pricing model will eventually push me away.",3,"Neat, helpful, costly"
382,"I was able to get my times to sync from USMS, but the page to view top times doesn't load correctly. 9/10 times it gets frozen or something and doesn't display any events or corresponding times. It also seems a little tedious to enter workout info. I don't want to keep track of every set, just the overall distance and strokes used. Please fix the bugs and make the interface easier to use!",3,"Cool idea, seems kind of buggy"
383,"I just started back swimming laps and using my new Apple Watch. I like the features of my swim pro, it does show the different strokes. I usually swim 200 yd sets. 200 free, 200 back then 200 breast. How do I get the app to register the different strokes. If I swim without stopping at the end of a set, the app reports free. I have tried to pause between sets, then the app stops and doesn't register the next set. The app has even gone inactive and not recorded the session.",3,How see different strokes
386,"I have high hopes for this app.  Would love to see the option to input my 100yd base interval.  The selection of beginner, intermediate, advanced seems too broad a bucket and I have no way of knowing if the workout intervals are designed for lots of rest or if I should manually drop the times.  Having heart rate data is great, but would like to see that used to help coach the appropriate workouts and intervals.  Thanks!",3,Add Base interval option please!
387,"If I could rate the app for the watch part probably a solid 3.5 stars 4 when you factory in the possibilities under future updates. But the phone part of the app is just off NO METRICS for anything really if you use a garmin swim watch 920xt or better or anything like that you will be disappointed to not find any of your stoke count, swolf report, or even pace per individual interval... glad I could unsubscribe immediately.",2,Tri/swim geeks don't get excited...
389,"Videos! Downloadable workouts! Stroke differentiation and auto-pause. Sure looks good and promises a lot. The problem is you can't actually start workouts from your Watch.

For 9.99, this app should be flawless. For the obscene subscription price of 9.99 a MONTH, having any issues at all is an insult.",1,Does everything except work.
391,I did my first workout but where is my data?  Also it took about ten laps for it to start recording my laps accurately.  I have gone online to try to figure out how to sync the iwatch with the app on the iPhone - nice looking blog site but does not share anything about using the iwatch or the app.  The app on the iwatch was short on instructions so i had no idea how to end the workout or save it.,2,Where are the instructions on how to use this?
393,"Was having problems with the app crashing, but that is fixed in most recent version of the app. Overall, I like the workouts and have seen improvements to my times using this app for training. 

Developers are pretty responsive and open to feedback. 

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

I'd love to see the app get smarter about rest time. If I always finish a set well below the suggested time then it should adjust.",3,Watch app crashing fixed

To say I'm disappointed is the understatement of the week. Hope they reach out.",1,Didn't work
395,It looks like all the pieces are here to benefit from integration with the Apple Watch series 2 but yet falls way short. Could only sink watch and app 1 x and couldn't even get work outs on the watch. Please fix the series 2 watch and app interface.

Please fix and you will have a new customer.,1,So much potential but not here yet
398,"It doesn't track your distance when you are kicking and doesn't account for long streamlines, so the distances end up off when you're done with a set, sometimes by quite a bit. My workouts are typically about 1,000 yards longer than the app indicates. 

It's okay and it probably does the most it can for what it is able, but I was expecting more.",2,Limited
399,"It freezes on my apple watch about twice in a 2 hour swim session. The mobile app also crashed multiple times when I would try to create workouts. Also, there's no way to create workouts for later, so you would have to create your workout right before you swim.",3,Almost good

486,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",2,Needs Work
489,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,1,Dr
490,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",2,Very limited app
491,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",1,lost workout - difficulty creating custom workouts
493,would most likely be a good app except for the fact that you can't do anything without a subscription im 14 years old and don't have $179.99 to spen in an app all i need to use is the dryland again seems like a really good app and has really good customer service but it's not for me (sorry if i offended anyone with this review),3,It's a no for me
496,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",2,MySwimPro by MyProgrammingAmateur
497,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall. I can build it but anytime I try to save it it is asking me to upgrade and won’t save it.  Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don’t need nor want the coaching help.
