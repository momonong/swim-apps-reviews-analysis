"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",4,0.25731092436974784,0.5712605042016806,positive
"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",5,0.2787878787878788,0.4062770562770562,positive
"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",5,0.24753623188405796,0.477463768115942,positive
"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",5,0.23888888888888882,0.5402777777777779,positive
"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",4,0.16682539682539682,0.5018253968253968,positive
"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",2,0.06444444444444444,0.39862433862433855,positive
"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",5,0.14069444444444446,0.5205555555555555,positive
"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",5,0.3292261904761905,0.4465873015873016,positive
"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",5,0.07115384615384615,0.42435897435897435,positive
"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",3,0.0037698412698412404,0.7361111111111113,positive
"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",5,0.29277777777777775,0.39777777777777784,positive
"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor.

I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning.

"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master.

"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",5,0.18884615384615386,0.5127564102564102,positive
"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself.

I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",4,0.12333333333333334,0.4397619047619048,positive
"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming.

"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",3,0.09230769230769233,0.5083333333333333,positive

"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",1,0.1509453781512605,0.7030462184873949,positive

"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market.

"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid.

My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",3,0.07766126516126517,0.37165867165867167,positive

"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",3,0.17955182072829134,0.5426237161531278,positive
"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",5,0.24181818181818188,0.4854545454545455,positive
"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",5,0.26875,0.296875,positive
"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",5,0.32291666666666663,0.35833333333333334,positive
"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",4,0.3816017316017316,0.4398268398268399,positive

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",2,0.1372331691297209,0.3353653530377669,positive

"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",2,0.14130434782608692,0.6634057971014492,positive
"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",1,0.12211538461538463,0.5292506105006104,positive

"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",2,0.11444692460317461,0.3259424603174603,positive
I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall. I can build it but anytime I try to save it it is asking me to upgrade and won’t save it.  Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don’t need nor want the coaching help.

amazing app. I signed up for the app about 2 weeks ago. straight away I got a lovely message inviting any questions. I asked about how I set the app up on my fitbit and I got a reply straight away and Charlie stayed messaging until I had it all sorted out. the app has lots of amazing features on training and technique and if you have any questions some one replies. it really is like having your own personal coach. love this app well worth the money for all the help.and advice you are given.,5,0.37,0.5549999999999999,positive

Activities cannot be deleted from Feeds item screen (activity's context menu item ""Delete"" does nothing) neither from Profile screen (no ""Delete"" option at all), if you have wrong or test activities - that garbage left forever. 2.

Simply it does not work. I tried to use on Garmin watch Fenix 5 and I don't know how an app like this has passed QA and how Garmin allows it on its application market. It has a lot of bad reviews and look that this company is not interested in fixing its issues. Also the company take time to reply reviews to explain the issue blaming Garmin of its poor behavior. My reply for this is very direct. MySwimPro if you don't have a a ready Production App do not put that in the market or allows Garmin to set that in its app store you are misleading clients like me of getting into an expensive subscription that does not work. and where the first response that you have as a company is to delegate the responsibility of you poor quality and control to other like Garmin,1,-0.16699999999999998,0.5152142857142856,negative

Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.   I'd suggest asking for times or usual swimming trainings and then the app could actually suggest times/distances according to that?

It's like your own personal coach in your pocket. Great workouts and I can't wait to start using this to get back into shape. I've swam for years and even at the college level but I have been out of it for a while now so having an app full of workouts will make it easy to get back in the water with so many great practices to pick from.,5,0.38703703703703707,0.5203703703703704,positive

If you go to the pool and sometimes can't figure out a workout on the top of your head. This app is for you. Just pick your swimming  level pick what you want to work on and your workout and you are off to the races. The best part is they give you links to YouTube videos of the drills you should be doing in the workout. :),5,0.6666666666666666,0.6,positive

"It has great potential. I like the training videos, there needs to be more of these. I'm not sure what 'descend 1-4' etc means, or 'just make'? You should also be able to select a workout based solely on strokes, distance or time, as sometimes you're time or stroke restricted. Breaststroke hurts my knee, so an option to auto design a workout based on stroke preference would be good. I like other users idea of a user database. It would definitely extend the usability of this app 10 fold.",3,0.265625,0.6548611111111111,positive
