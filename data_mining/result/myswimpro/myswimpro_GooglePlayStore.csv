0,5,"I have always been a good distance swimmer, but not a fast one. I don't particularly care to race, but I do want to swim faster, improve my techniques, and get the best swim workouts possible. This app helps me do just that. From the technique videos to guided workouts and monthly challenges, my swimpro has coached me to better swimming in a short time. Love this app! It's a totally worthwhile investment!"
1,4,"While this app seems very progressive, easy to use and like a genuinely good option for learning swimmers, athletes, etc., it costs a lot just to get a training plan! It would be great if I can just learn new techniques and become a better swimmer without having to pay 9.99$ a month - which I can ALREADY learn how to be with my school's swim coach. I don't think it should cost this much for an extra boost."
2,5,"As a beginner swimmer who is working on my strokes and techniques, the app has been helpful in having everything I need in one place. The video demonstration and the workout plan in one place is really helpful for someone who either is new to swimming or is an advanced swimmer. The monthly challenges inside the app also keeps it fun to stay active and hold oneself accountable for it. Adding the dryland training has been very helpful as well."
3,3,"If you never swam competitively ever, or dont want the hassle of doing a quick google search, then this app is okay. However, as a past swimmer and current coach, the sets are somewhat stale, and the majority of them are behind what i would consider to be a decently high paywall. i get the desire to charge for this, but it shouldbt be nearly so expensive, and you shouls feel like you are getting a lot more for your money. The only nice thing i see is that they are color coded"
4,1,"Update: moving down to one star as I've contacted support and received no answer. App seems good, but is very buggy...good workouts, but interface is often crashing or lagging, wont log workout plans, etc. Paid for the Premium subscription and now it wont give me access to premium features...and appears to have deleted a week of data. I'm sure Ill have a heck of a time getting any refund! Needed improvement to keep my business...now Im going to an alternate app."
5,5,Love this app! I started using this app on the free model! I created my own custom workouts each day and then loaded them onto my watch! I eventually decided to try the 7 day free trial to use all of the features and I wish I had done it sooner! The workout of the day is what I normally do and I love being able to track my split times and see my improvement over time! Customer support has been super helpful with getting me set up on my subscription( -had some issues with the play store)
6,3,"Hello ,there I would like to talk about this app ,I just understand that if you don't have a credit card or money you aren't not able to get experience of this app . It's okay your app's styles design, programs look attractive, however, at least for costumers there might be free versions like a trial ,and if the costumers or people like it they'll already try to upgrade and get the premium, to sum up , do something in this app free without requiring a credit card 💳."
7,2,Really like the app for the most part. Especially with how it looks on all of their youtube videos. But that is on ios. Going to have to unsubscribe due to the fact that it always seems that the android and garmin integration takes a back seat to Apple. I have been using premium for ~1/2 a year waiting with the promise the android and garmin integration will catch up to Apple. And have not seen it yet. The app looks great on the Apple devices but looks old and clunky on Android and garmin.
8,1,"You can see nothing without paying money. Can't open even one workout. Every page, every button redirects to the subscription page. It's not the app, it's just a paywall simulator"
9,1,App is not at all as per expectations. Workout videos are not loading. It takes hell lot of time to see the video and the video don't stream properly. It's very annoying to wait for video to buffer. Even response from customer support is very poor. Overall not a good experience.
10,2,"Experience is very lacking in Android. The app is buggy, and missing many basic features available on iOS. My activities don't load with split information on them, except for the very first split. Every time. I can properly see every split in the Garmin app so it's not an issue with the watch. Swim times don't update at all by themselves despite saying they do. In iOS you even get an applause animation telling you if your progress. Feed only shows my own activities, doesn't show my friend's"
11,1,"Says in app purchases in description, not that you get a 7 day free trial then pay a fortune. The free version advertised was not an option. You had to subscribe to set up app. Misleading and uninstalling"
12,5,"I have the book ""swim like a pro"" signed by Mr. Fares Ksebati himself. Yes, I met him in person. He is very energetic in person, super cool and kind. He is the best remote swim coach ever. I have read the book (all time helpful in all things swimming your questions will be answered) and down loaded the app ( You can learn to swim like a pro). Best thing you can do for yourself, no matter what your swim level. Join the community. Thank you, coach."
13,1,App worked great for 3 weeks and is now crashing everyrime it is opened.
14,3,It works well to sync with Garmin and the workouts are well planned out. But it is extremely annoying that everytime I need to open the app to get a workout. I need to input the same information before it shows me the main page. I always have to reconfigure the distance and reselect my goals. It would be nice if it would save what had been input since the beginning. Plus drill videos should be included at all time even if seen previously.
15,2,"The application needs a lot of work. There too many bugs such as broken videos, not able to keep my personal settings (level, measurement of the pool) which leads me to renter them in every login. The UX is not easy to understand, you have to invest time and effort to use it. The perks of the application doesn't reconcile with the price in my opinion. Hence the two stars, just for the effort and the intention. I would suggest to find a proper testing team and redesign it to a simpler version."
16,2,"This app does not look like what is shown on YouTube videos or even the photos used here. I think it is optimized more for Apple(?) I am guessing that is where all the nice layout of the app is from because I don't see it on mine. Also, I'm only able to sync the workout from the app to my garmin and can't load my stats back into the app which I'm supposedly able to. But workouts are good if subscribed to premium, just lacking some clarity."
17,1,"Hardly any updates in the past 2 years and now you ratchet up the price? Yeah no. Good luck being greedy. Coach section rarely loads, app is extremely slow, ads show up on the videos provided to you on paid subscription. This is a fairly expensive app and I expected much much more. Wish I hadn't have paid for the subscription. Great idea, great potential, fail on execution and delivery."
18,4,"Helped me swim my first 1500m open swim!! A bit pricey, but for someone without any background, or minimal background in swimming; the app is cheaper than hiring a coach or joining swim class."
19,5,"Love it. Great workouts good videos, works perfect with applewatch. Cons only seems to be sync with apple and garmin"
20,1,"I can't even setup my profile as the app doesn't recognise the size of the pool I swim in, which is 14m. Please fix this issue."
21,5,"Easy to use, you can pick and choose from available workouts or make your own. Syncs to my Garmin watch so I don't need a pace clock, and can workout without the hassle! After a week of use, it randomly stopped working on my Garmin Fenix 5X. Charlie from MySwimPro's tech support spent the better part of the last few days working to resolve the issue with me. Already loved the app, but the effort put in to fix the issue was outstanding. Great app and an even better team behind it!"
22,1,So many bugs in this app. Synchronization issues are among the most annoying but many other smaller bugs. The Android version is super far behind of what is advertised on their webpage. Very misleading! The workouts are good but useless if you can't properly sync it.
23,1,Technical terms were not explained. My goal is not to get faster yet that's the plan I was given.
24,2,"(Disclaimer: I'm using unpaid version) Many features/buttons not functioning. Unable to update profile through settings button and unable to join any of the April challenges. Also, there's nothing to see in the feed unless you're following people, but as a new user, you're not following anyone yet, so feed is dead. Just white space. White disappointed with the whole thing. I'm an average swimmer and want to improve my strength and speed. Hoping this app would've helped."
25,1,"I have been following the YouTube channel for over a year now. Thought of using the app, however, I am not able to go past the sign up page. I used log in using Facebook option, but after that nothing happens. It says on the log in screen. I had to Uninstall the app."
26,3,"The content is great but the app itself is awful to use and the woman's robot voice is horrendous. The app doesn't seem to open things when you press on them, or it'll play the wrong video or open the wrong thing. It takes you back a page or two when you are trying to look at something. Overall really horrible to use sadly."
27,1,"You keep saying a big update is coming. I got a compatible watch (garmin 945) and no matter what I try I can't pair the watch. I can't connect Garmin Sync. Or Strata. The sync turns on. I log in. It completes and as soon as the app is closes or I Simply go back, the switch simply turns off again. Incredibly frustrating."
28,1,"Was led to this app by the youtube video's but to my dismay, it's a money grab. Expected more (silly me) from their youtube videos being so helpful. Will only let you see 1 swim workout unless you pay the monthly or yearly subscription. Thanks for this. As im new to swimming, i needed something to help me, but it seems I'll just do it myself, and if not, I'll just stick to running. I'm very disappointed."
29,1,"Not very functional: the app adjusted the swims I imported to include rest times within the swim times within sets, so that is frustrating. Every training plan requires a membership subscription. $120, upfront? When there are loads of good free pans out there? I was expecting to see more metrics of my swims but, no. Slow. Disappointing. Avoid."
30,1,"$119.00! You only receive vocabulary definitions unless you pay ""Premium"" subscriptions. There are three video packages total cost $119.00!. The videos are like 30 seconds. Rather defeating because the app seems good if you pay. Otherwise useless. Access to nothing. I am not seeing $120 value. Very misleading."
31,3,"Great workouts on it, but no easy way for basic swim tracking. UPDATE: Thanks for the response, but I am not swimming much anymore. My rating was a bit low before; it's nice that it works on watches, even if it's a bit convoluted."
32,1,There is almost no information on the swim session. A simple workout in fitbit records so much more information. I'm very disappointed with the app. And they expect almost 200€ per year. Total waste of money.
33,1,"Just installed again to start a swim plan, it was ok before but now I can't even get the app to sync with my Forerunner 945... my watch just freezes. I wanted something to structure and track workouts for me.... looks like this isn't it, thankfully only losing 10 bucks."
34,1,"Swim workouts seem legit, however no real guidance to do the test workouts to get the dynamic pacing in place. Analysis is extra, 50, 100 or 150 bucks... But no explanation what that entails. No coach profiles to see what their credentials are. The Garmin IQ app integration is worthless, doesn't work at all. After some research this is an ongoing issue for over a year. App is a good concept. Just not refined enough for 119 a year. There are free alternatives that work flawlessly."
35,1,"I downloaded and subscribed to the app after following the YouTube channel which is very informative. The app is slow and extremely non-user friendly! Haven't been able to get a hang of it. Secondly, I canceled my subscription the very same day due to the stated reason, however, the refund has also been rejected. Every app gives an initial free trial. Been trying to make use of it for the month now, but not a fan for obvious reason. So all in all, quite a bad experience."
36,5,Beginner swimmer who never was on a team but always loved the water. So far I have already learned new things about how to better swim freestyle. Also the video explaining workout jargon was priceless. I can't believe how I instantly started swimming faster. Surreal! Love it!
37,5,"This app has changed the way I swim and the way I train. The developers are responsive and helpful whenever I've had questions, and the training programs and coaching ideas and tips make swim training fun, different and never boring. I only started swimming for exercise as an adult and now love the water."
38,1,"This app does not work according to the details on an android phone. I created / built my own swim workouts and I not only can send them to my Garmin, I cant even edit the workouts. The pen and three dots at the top of the page are frozen and cannot be selected... fix this so the app works in free mode as advertised...."
39,1,"I pay for the subscription and the app wouldn't let me start a plan. I cancelled the subscription and reactivated it again and I was promt to an error message, ""app will continue in a few minutes "". Never worked. I was looking forward to this app. If anyone has suggestions let me know or a new app for beginners. thanks"
40,1,"€200 for a yearly membership? Making it one of the most expensive sport apps in history. You have lost your ever loving mind if you think I am paying that insane price for your app. There is no talking that greedy grab right, or you have a really bad business model. In any case: NO WAY! Also from other reviews, reading about lots of issues and bugs. Making it even more outrageous. You have lost a user, account deleted and app uninstalled"
41,2,Unable to download workout to my watch despite it being compatible. Support very helpful but after multiple emails it still wouldn't work so have given up. It's a shame as its a great concept but not willing to pay for full membership if have to print out training plans.
42,1,NOT USER FRIENDLY! Having difficulties navigating. Can't access some of the workouts even with my subcription. I feel like I just got jipped! Just lost close to a hundred dollars on my subscription which is worthless and pointless since I cant get the workout I want to load and doesnt others. Disapointing!!😡
43,1,"Not a great integration with Garmin watch (Venu 2). The app for the phone is useless and the integration does not properly reads laps and rest time. Also, no updated of the app that match the features of the Apple version."
44,5,"This app is brilliant, great integration with my Garmin fenix 5 plus, really good workouts and personal coaching. Live the app and won't swim without it. The help desk at myswimpro team are really helpful and hit me up and running with the minimal of fuss, great communication throughout. I highly recommend this app if you swim competitively or are serious about your swim sessions."
45,5,Helped me go from not knowing the first thing about swimming proper to pounding out 2500 yard workouts in three months. As a former collegiate athlete (tennis) I understand and appreciate the value that structured training plans can provide in accelerating along the path toward a fitness goal. Five stars for this app ... especially with a premium membership plan.
46,5,"I use this with my Fitbit Iconic and I love that my workout is all on my wrist - I don't have to worry about memorizing intervals or keeping my workout dry on a piece of paper. I also feel much more motivated since I don't have to put any more energy into creating a workout, I just hop in the pool!"
47,1,"There is no short free trial to test this app out. They ask for you to subscribe before even seeing any other screen in the app. Somehow that seems fishy to me, asking for $90 a year before even seeing the product. To trial the app, you must commit to an annual $90 subscription. There is no other trial available, even with the monthly $15 plan."
48,5,amazing app. I signed up for the app about 2 weeks ago. straight away I got a lovely message inviting any questions. I asked about how I set the app up on my fitbit and I got a reply straight away and Charlie stayed messaging until I had it all sorted out. the app has lots of amazing features on training and technique and if you have any questions some one replies. it really is like having your own personal coach. love this app well worth the money for all the help.and advice you are given.
49,5,This app is the most usefull app I have ever bought. I do a lot of cross-training and wanted to do more than fight the water for hours on end. I find this app brings me what I need to improve my skill both programming and showing how to. I had some problems learning how to sync my results but got help with that from the TeamSwimPro. ##THIS APP IS THE BEST##
50,1,Taking much money cant take free only want money. I think they should not take money. They only want money sports is not for money. I am also a swimmer I thought this app is cool but they are taking a lot amount of money. I can afford it but the other people those who want to be a swimmer and are middle class they can not afford it! I know you have a youtube channel I see your videos in 1 video you told about your app so I downloaded it but a lot amount of money your app will not work at all!!!!
51,1,Cannot log into the app. Tried resetting my password and creating a new account with a different email but the app just gets stuck in the loading screen. Real shame as I love the toutube videos.
52,1,does not work. I had a paid subscription and everytime I go to my plan it keeps trying to get me to sign up again. I went to my subscriptions and it billed me 3 times and I still couldn't get to my swim plan. looks like a great idea if it worked.
53,1,"No good for free membership! If you want to learn and achieve better technique go to a different app unless you wanna pay monthly. All plans that theu recommended to me are under Premium membership, absolutely pointless when I know I could get others for free."
54,5,"5 swims in and loving it. Some adjustment using with my Garmin watch, but that is mostly on me, I think. I really like the variety in the workouts and the dynamic intervals make the workouts achievable for me!"
55,1,"it took my payment details/ google password for the free trial offer saying that after the trial period, payment will start. however , once i shared the details, it didnt let me see the trial programme on offer (7 day trial programme) . very unhappy with the experience. i suspect this app is a hoax. i dont want to be charged for anything as i have not used any service."
56,1,rates are too high
57,2,"Doesn't really offer anything beyond what a can get with a pen & paper & local pool membership. Billing is annual, so $120 upfront which, for me is better spent for specific training / advice. Not really what I was looking for. YMMV"
58,1,"Way less better than I thought. Repeatedly approaches you with offers that obviously cost money and more than half of the features aren't available without payment. Everytime I start a workout, it just exits out and doesn't even start anything."
59,4,"My original 1 star review is below. This was changed to four star after their quick response and action. The app is not for me but the customer support has been highly competent, punctual and understanding.My advice would be to use the trial period effectively to comprehend the structure of what is being offered.  ""Trial period automatically taxes a yearly subscription without explicit gated consent even if app is uninstalled. Avoid"""
60,2,"The app was laggy and it kept returning me back every time I tried to chose a plan, the plans are really confusing and not a lot of explanation is available. It feels hacky and cheap to spend that much money on such an app"
61,1,Won't save anything under your profile. Coach doesn't seem to change. Can't organize workouts right. Custom workout builder barely works at all. buggy mess. Doesn't save any workouts or workout changes. Going to ask for my money back.
62,5,"Excellent concept, well-designed training plans, and superb customer service"
63,1,Does not work as intended. Can not manage account or cancel free trial.
64,1,There's nothing you could use unless you get premium. I uninstalled it after a few mins since its useless unless you pay. There's 30 days trial but you should have atleast some free vidoes or a shorter workout plan so users can test it out before we give you our credit card info. I cant access anything.
65,1,Slow and unresponsive when trying to log workouts but unusual fast and responsive when trying to get you to buy a subscription.
66,1,"They tell you is free. But once you download the app, all the exercises and techniques and practically EVERYTHING has a cost. They want you to pay ""$179.99"" for a yearly membership if you want to actually use the app or see anything. I'm so piss... BEWARE OF THIS APP"
67,3,"It's ok, the subscription is really pricey, $120! The integrated workouts aren't great, but you can design your own to print which is nice."
68,1,the app was messing up my pool yards. when I listened to the email regarding it they said uninstall the app the reinstall it. I than lost everything. I logged into my account and everything was gone even my premium membership.
69,1,I was disappointed that the app does not do basic recording of the distance swam. Most options on offer require premium payment which is expensive at 119 US dollars for a year's subscription.
70,1,Absolutely no free content. Free trial requires pay credentials already
71,2,"I did the test of 3 most famous Apps: I. Pool Swim Garmin (native). II. SwimSports+ Garmin Connect IQ. III. MySwimPro Garmin Connect IQ & Android App. I must say, that MySwimPro works much-much better than other ones (including measuring and convenience to use in pool almost w/o necessity to look at watch every couple minutes). Still, Can developer explain the critical issues below (which prevent me to use App): 1. Activities cannot be deleted from Feeds item screen (activity's context menu item ""Delete"" does nothing) neither from Profile screen (no ""Delete"" option at all), if you have wrong or test activities - that garbage left forever. 2. Parameter Settings->Workouts->RestTimeBetweenSets does not work, if you point 10 secs, 15 secs, etc. - on watch side (Garmin F6XP) the MySwimPro app ALWAYS countdowns 30 secs between Sets and 60 secs between Groups. 3. After Workout ended, saved and watch synced (App option ""Garmin pair & authorized sync"" are turned on) - App's Activities had not shown in my Feeds/Profile until I re-installed App. 4. Watch App (Garmin) does not vibrate a watch device while you are out of / back to HR Zone described for Sets."
72,2,Way too expensive for what it offers on the Android side. Definitely more geared towards an Apple wearable. There are plenty of free workouts online and on USMS. Save your money.
73,1,"After one day using it the app just lag for hours and I can't transfer any workout on the Fitbit watch. I reinstall the whole thing and now it won't even log-in. Crappy app, badly designed."
74,1,"Provides some coaching and workout plans, but is generally worthless otherwise. It just transfers actual data to whatever parent app you have installed."
75,3,"I would have likely subscribed had the app integrated with Garmin's pool swim and workouts instead of MSP CIQ app. Good: - auto create & send workouts to device - technique videos - auto detection of improvement (dynamic intervals) - workouts and plans Improve: - CIQ app inferior to stock Garmin pool swim/workouts (alerts, rest screens, etc) - more plans for intermediate swimmers - All ""leave on"" sets; no ""Rest Interval"" - un-exusable bugs (delete/rename activities broken entire 30-day trial)"
76,2,"It looked good enough at the first glance, but ALL of the dryland plans come only with the premium version, and the free part of the swim plans are uninteresting. How do you want users to pay for something they cannot test? Very sad."
77,1,Used to be able to sync my workouts with my fitbit versa 2. Worked great. Can no longer do this. Not much available for someone on a tight budget.
78,1,"App seems OK, but Russian translation is of terrible quality, only half-done (literally 50% is Russian and 50% is still English, that`s awful), and is enforced - there is no way to switch to English. Please add a language selector."
79,1,You must subscribe to use app. lousy come on.
80,5,i love having every workout pre-planned. having it poolside really helps. the videos are great. i've learned a lot.
81,5,"It's the next best thing to having a coach on deck with you. A must have for any serious swimmer who trains on their own. I'm getting so much more out of it than I expected. Wish I'd bought it sooner! UPDATE: This app is backed by a team of folks committed to making it better and better. I reported a couple of bugs, a"
82,5,"Nice app, neatly organised. Guided instructions, technique video, training drills, and white board Wednesday's makes your workouts more structured and streamlined. The science behind the app is effectively managed by team MySwimPro."
83,1,"This just doesn't work on my Fossil Gen 5. Installed on my phone and watch, but the watch keeps saying it needs Pro features, and even though I started the 7 day trial, the app wouldn't allow me to use any of the Pro features."
84,1,"Uninstalling after 30 mins of checking the app. Cost almost $300/yr for premium. Free plans is useless. The free youtube videos are better, and it's free."
85,1,"Everything is premium I installed the app to learn different swimming technics, after about 5 mins I decided to come here and write that I found nothing free to look at. Every video I checked is premium, every workout is premium, all I pressed on was premium, are you serious???"
86,1,So the app is free but theres literally nothing free on it? Not a single simple training video or anything I can see to give me any idea of how the app actually is and how your videos are presented. Or am I missing something because everything I look at says premium?
87,1,There's nothing free in this app. It's too bad because I cannot afford to subscribe. I was able to do custom workouts and send to my watch but now for even that I need to subscribe.
88,3,Seems to be a nice app but costly. I was led into this app from the YouTube videos of Fares. Installed on my android phone and could not get any plan for free. I feel you should let users try out the app before making the purchase. Also 1300 Indian Rupees per month seems costly for an app. Will come back to this app if the rates are brought down
89,1,Deceitful app and feel cheated. Took all my personal info and then wanted to charge $179.00 for use. No acces to any basic features. No mention of payment at all until end.
90,1,Can't so anything with the free version. Every action prompts you to sign up to a subscription. Including watching videos that are available for free on YouTube. Why offer a free version??
91,1,Android user here. The app failed to register my details. I was actually looking forward getting back to swimming and have a more structured approach but I'll probably wait until this gets fixed. As of now its a 1 out of 5.
92,1,"Opened the app, and uninstalled in a few minutes. $120 subscription, really? Maybe make it $5/month or something. You will lose a lot of potential customers because of this annually charged crazy price."
93,1,I couldn't even choose the Free plan. Not sure if the UI stuff didn't load/render properly or if it is something else.
94,1,"No free content at all, everything is premium. For someone just trying to learn and start out and not sure if they want to spend money this is not the app for you. Keep looking."
95,5,They are constantly improving the app and the workouts are terrific. Really easy to follow.
96,2,"The training plan online wasn't on the app. Downloaded because the website stated the only way to see the training plan was on the app, but now I've downloaded the app it's impossible to find."
97,4,Not that much on offer for free. If I get more serious with my swimming I'll probably upgrade because there does seem to be plenty of training on offer.
98,1,"Connection error from watch to phone. Fix your bugs. ""Free App"" works great if you subscribe for a monthly/yearly fee"
99,5,As a swimmer myself this motavates me to beat my friends in the many swim competitions that this app runs. I highly recommend if your looking for an easy to use fitness app.
100,4,"Had some issues getting going, but this was sorted after a while. Pace calculations for sets syncing from Garmin include rest time, so you always appear very slow"
101,1,Downloaded this after watching some good YouTube videos. Disappointed to find EVERYTHING is behind a huge paywall despite the video suggesting otherwise. Will take my custom elsewhere.
102,5,I've always struggled organizing my swim workouts and so I quit pretty quickly. Having well structured workouts has made my life so much easier!
103,1,I could not get pass 1st base my fitbit said to enter a code in the app and the app dosen't have a place to enter the code to pair. Very useless app for my fitbit.
104,4,"The workouts and training plans are awesome. The app on a Garmin watch runs the workout letting you know when to start and rest without looking at a wall clock. Just press start and follow the instructions on your watch screen. 5-stars when the finished swim that uploads to Garmin Connect breaks down the intervals rather than a single continuous swim, and when Strava + Garmin sync are enabled you don't see 2 workouts on Strava (1 from MSP and 1 from Garmin for the same swim)."
105,5,told about it from a friend and never going back. I've never been committed to better ny swimming until i had the crazy thought to train for a triathlon and this all has bettered my swimming so much!
106,4,Very good app..but needs more training programs. Also should be updated to be synced with Galaxy watch.
107,1,"Hi, I've been trying to pay for the elite coach plan but the app send me an error OR-CAC-02 every time I'm trying to pay with PayPal or my credit card."
108,1,"Seems like a great app, but can you catch up and add the Garmin Venu 2 plus, canceled my subscription because all the other Venus are available but the plus."
109,5,On my second week of training and loving how much more productive my workouts are with MySwimPro. Great phone support from the dev team. Can't wait to see the next features!
110,1,"I wasn't a fan and had hard time trying to cancel the subscription...tried to reset my password and received no email, i was charged and now am disputing it with the credit card company"
111,5,Update: After update Finally all working fineLast update not working properly on my Android phone. All my workouts doesn't open. Also i can't create a pdf. I re-install the app and all my saved workouts disappeared. Please fix 🙏
112,1,Basically you can't do or watch NOTHING without paying. It'll more convenient of it's a paid app not to be categorized as free app.
113,1,There is virtually nothing you can do without paying a premium subscription. How can I know if is worth the money or not without trying ? By the Way pretty expensive membership
114,1,It stops working all the time. It is impossible to start any dryland plan. It is the worst actualization ever.
115,1,Doesn't support android watches. The main reason I downloaded. In my opinion the app is pointless without Android watch support.
116,2,"Too costly for India, middle class family cannot afford it even though at 50% discount"
117,5,"the app is great, the workouts are well constructed, and the smart watch interface is really nice"
118,1,"I just installed this app and tried to log a workout, using the option ""Quick Log"" but isn't working ...keeps saying error logging workout"
119,2,"very poor performances of the app, missing data and didn't upload properly the info received from garmin watch, unfortunately not recommended"
120,1,Couldn't create a new account using any of the available options. There were no error messages that explain why the account creation failed.
121,1,"Useless without premium subscription. And yes, I can have 30days if premium for free but doesn't change the point"
122,1,You cannot do ANYTHING without paying. Why not charge for the app up front ? Feels scummy. Uninstalled.
123,3,Can't include set distance with time rest period when creating a workout. All has to be done by intervals.
124,1,It's not an app ... It's a bank When l press on the free membership then choose the workout .. click the start plan button I got myself back in infinity loop to the elite or free membership
125,1,Unusable without the premium. Also pretty sure my address was leaked to spam emails and my inbox is full of them now
126,1,"cant even connect to fitbit, says enter authorization number in the setting, but in the settings there no options where to key on the number"
127,5,Great training program for all levels. Enjoy the integration with fitbit versa.
128,1,"Hasn't installed properly on vivoactive3. Hangs on ""login to phone"" and gives errors on phone screen."
129,5,"Very nice app, and the support from the developers is great! Always happy and prompt to help!"
130,3,"it's good if you have a compatible tracking watch , check before buying watch or app."
131,1,Fit bit says to enter code but app does not give you the place to set the app. Im guessing unless you pay for subscription .
132,1,Can't access anything except continually being asked to upgrade. Waste of time.
133,1,"Used to work fine, but now that the pools are actually open again you literally can't open any of the training plans."
134,1,I just want to record an outdoor free swim and it is way too complicated.
135,1,worst app i paid for yearly subscription but no videos are playing there are many problems in app don't go for paid subscription
136,5,The my swim pro app is amazing!
137,1,"I've tried syncing to Strava, Garmin, and Google Fit, and 0 of my activities show up in this app."
138,1,Not really a free app if you can't use anything on it without purchasing the $200+ yearly subscription....
139,5,"I love the app! great workouts, also super personalisable and functions great with my Garmin :)"
140,1,"sorry way to pricey for premium training plans, and really nothing of use to me in the basic app."
141,1,App will not connect to Wear OS smartwatch. Wear OS app seems like an after thought.
142,1,You can't access any training sessions without going through a subscription pay wall. Uninstalled.
143,1,For starters . If you do not have 10k go invest in it then your wasting your time.. all these schedules requires elite subscriptions so limiting many folks
144,1,Unreliable and unstable android version. Seldom works right.
145,1,The app looked really promising but does not work well at all with Garmin devices. Do not buy if you have Garmin.
146,1,I subscribed for a year but the app didn't let me access to any of the swimming plans.
147,1,The coach option does not work... What is happening? Fix the bug!
148,1,one of the worst swimming apps I have ever tried. thank goodness it was free trial for 7 days only....
149,1,"awful to use, confusing, couldn't link to fitbit versa, no helpful advice online. deleted :("
150,2,+ structured workouts - drills not linked to videos - set timings off but should improve by entering personalized intervals
151,5,Pretty good. Also impressed that the developer is responsive with feedback.
152,1,"There are no free workouts to get you started. Thought this was related to myfitnesspro, but it is not. Would love to review it but I'm not paying $110.00 to try this thing!!!"
153,2,Wasted. has great potential but i am not willing to pay that much. I immediately uninstalled. $120/year..... wow.
154,1,Doesnt work. It kept trying to charge me for workouts I already paid for. Not worth the time
155,2,iOS version is great but android one is really lacking and has lots of bugs
156,2,It will not allow me to add an activity without an interval. That's annoying.
157,1,"This app is unusable unless you want to pay for a premium subscription, it's worthless."
158,1,"Free version is a joke. Unless you are willing to buy premium, there is no reason to install the app."
159,5,"Hi, I made an update, and it works properly. I use this app on Fenix 6. Thanks Peter"
160,1,Horrible. It does not connect to my fitbit versa at all .
161,1,Costs too much. Everything requires the monthly plan :/
162,3,Nice app. Can you add an option to sync workouts with Runtastic?
163,5,Great app for logging my swims and great for tips and advice.
164,1,It's a useless app for unpaid users. Every button requests you to by a plan!
165,1,Its really bad if you want to workout (on land ) you have to pay for everything
166,1,"Maybe don't crush me with notifications, and I'll keep the app on my phone."
167,2,Not free. Most stuff are unlocked when you pay.
168,1,"Very bad working of app, Everything is monetize after labeling it free...horrible"
169,2,very buggy app -Doesn't explain workouts properly -Interval calibration is not good
170,1,Simply it does not work. I tried to use on Garmin watch Fenix 5 and I don't know how an app like this has passed QA and how Garmin allows it on its application market. It has a lot of bad reviews and look that this company is not interested in fixing its issues. Also the company take time to reply reviews to explain the issue blaming Garmin of its poor behavior. My reply for this is very direct. MySwimPro if you don't have a a ready Production App do not put that in the market or allows Garmin to set that in its app store you are misleading clients like me of getting into an expensive subscription that does not work. and where the first response that you have as a company is to delegate the responsibility of you poor quality and control to other like Garmin
171,1,I cam download the app for free but then can't do anything without paying. Misleading.
172,4,Hello. How can I sync an Amazfit GTS to this app? I am looking for an app that would count each swimming session with detailed swimming style for each lap. Thank you in advance
173,4,"I hope your app on Huawei watch so i can use it perfectly, thanks."
174,5,The resources and workouts are awesome!
175,1,Don't waste your money or time. YouTube videos provide more info than this useless app.
176,1,"Extremely slow, takes forever to load"
177,5,It's really hard and challenging but I like a challenge
178,1,Doesn't work with Garmin at all!!! CANNOT choose Garmin device in setting; and I don't see how the plan will transfer to Garmin Connect or Garmin Instinct - I use.
179,5,Don't know why there are so many low ratings.. this app is great. Best app for swimming.
180,5,"Great workouts and instruction, I love this app."
181,2,difficult to create and save workouts
182,1,You have to pay for everything. I couldnt find anything that wasnt behind the pay wall. Thanks Bye.
183,5,Great for Dry land Swim Workout A suggestion kindly include specific dry land swm workout specifically for each stroke Cheers Mate
184,5,Fares Ksebati is excellent.
185,1,Useless literally and very expensive by the way.
186,1,Stuiped app not working well
187,1,"Frustrating, & paid subscription is REQUIRED!"
188,1,I just hate these apps that promise free participation and then you asked to pay 199 dollars. What an utter shambles.
189,5,"Great variety, I can't wait to get back in the pool"
190,1,No free trial The first screen is to subscribe then Immediately asks for money
191,1,myswimpro is useless unless you pay the annual fee of almost $200.
192,4,Training sessions are awesome.
193,1,Really disapointing nothing free.... Have to pay £85 to get any workout activities
194,1,"When I press start, it says Error Loading Workout. Why did I buy this?"
195,2,Not able to unsubscribe in the app settings.
196,1,"Could not find a free option to use the app, so uninstalled."
197,2,Workouts almost never save properly
198,1,I have to keep logging in everytime I use the app
199,1,This application essentially requires you to purchase a very expensive premium plan in order to do anything useful.
200,1,App is not good. Youtube is better don't download
201,2,My garmin 945 is not synching open water swims. Msp hasnt synched since march 11 my last pool workout. I have tried everything an. d its not working.
202,1,"Do you really think I'm going to sign up and pay money for a product I've never tried before? I don't even know if I'll like it yet, but I'm already hit with your paywall."
203,5,Great. Linking with Garmin watch works well
204,5,Very experienced and powerful app
205,5,"nice app, it is helpful and has great information"
206,1,the app takes me in loop between training plans page and the membership page
207,1,Garmin pairing and sync doesn't work. Terrible interfacd
208,4,I can't create my daily workout anymore in free mode 😭
209,1,Does this app even give you swimming lessons at all.? You need to pay... its not free
210,2,Could not find a single free workout.
211,1,I don't know why there are no free workouts now!
212,3,My main complaint from my previous review seems to be either fixed or was on me.
213,5,"Fantastic app, brilliant!"
214,1,not paying for this
215,1,"Will not work without payment, we have pay for everything"
216,1,Not a free app like advertised
217,1,Have to pay for it to be any use
218,1,It should be free in order to be hugely popular!
219,1,Tbh this app is useless unless u pay for the premium
220,1,"Whatever I choose, it asks to buy a plan.... Uninstalled :("
221,3,Unable to login..
222,1,Bad it does not connect to Garmin ... Bad bad bad
223,1,pro membership is damn expensive
224,1,It still needs a lot of improvements.
225,5,The best app for swimmers 🏊‍♂️
226,1,Worthless without subscription.
227,5,Still new here but it's clear I'm going to enjoy using this app
228,1,New update deleted all my information great work guys
229,1,On my Ionic it stays on loading forever.
230,3,can't find this app in the store on my Fossil Gen5
231,1,Everything useful is paid
232,3,Can not get it set up
233,2,does it connect to fitbit inspire hr
234,5,I love it!_ its great!.
235,1,"Don't download it, it's Spam."
236,4,it feel different than what Fares Ksebati said on MySwimPro YouTube channel...
237,5,best app for swimmers
238,5,Great app for swimmers
239,1,Everything is locked behind a paywall
240,1,Have to pay for everything
241,1,Pay pay pay. A lot !
242,5,Must have app for swimmers!
243,4,it's looks nice let's see 😊
244,1,Too high price
245,1,First pay then only it's working
246,5,Great for club swimmers
247,5,That's a great app
248,1,Can't do anything without paying 200$
249,1,i just wasted my 36 mb
250,3,Where is the Wear OS version?
251,1,cannot create new account.
252,5,"Hello, do you support Garmin Swim?"
253,1,Everything is paywalled
254,1,Wasn't what I needed
255,1,In app purchases
256,3,why remove my review?
257,1,Doesn't work on garmin fenix 6x
258,1,wants you to pay
259,1,Cost money trying.to fool you
260,1,You have to pay
261,5,MySwimPro💙
262,5,nice
263,1,very slow
264,5,good
265,1,too expensive
266,1,too expensive
267,1,Bad app
268,2,1hyt
269,5,Very useful
270,1,Not working
271,1,Total useless
272,1,paywalls
273,5,Good workouts
274,5,Nice
275,5,Great app!
276,1,Malware
277,5,Very good
278,3,parece q está bien pero cuando te la instalar prácticamente estás obligado a pagar
279,5,تمارين مختلفة تناسب السباحين المبتدئين و المحترفين و سهولة في الاستخدام بالإضافة انه يمكن تحميل التمرين علي ساعتي الجارمن فينكس ٥
280,1,paid services
281,5,Good enough
282,5,Great idea!
283,5,Spierdalaj
284,1,Loading forever
285,1,I would like to request a refund but there is no advice on this on your app
286,1,"Rubbish app, expected some sort of swimming metrics or history from garmin but nothing. Also all workouts don't load as a free user. Great in principal, money sponge in practice."
287,2,"I have no idea how to access any of the free features of this app or how to 
get it to connect to my fitbit. It does not seem to want to help me log my 
swims. I have access to Swimtag for free at my pool which is far more use."
288,1,"Cannot choose a program.  Keeps telling me ""error subscribing to training plan"" when I click Start Plan."
289,5,Famtastic! Stupendous!
290,2,"Ok edited my one star. It does sync with Strava and also Garmin Connect 
buried in Settings. Fairly crippled without an $8 per month membership. 
That what I pay per year for my Sailing Association and 37 races, a cruise 
program and meetings with 115 families??? Dont see that value here 
buddies???"
291,1,"Was written that it could sync between strava. Wanted to sync my garmin 
workouts TO the app but you can't."
292,1,"There's an application for the Fitbit versa, but the mobile app is 
confusing, and it doesn't connect to Fitbit app or directly to the versa, 
making it pretty useless for now"
293,1,"Could not login through fb or Twitter. Why can't we use it without login? 
Useless. Just displays ""error signing up"" alert"
294,5,"I just started swimming and I love this app! I have improved so much with 
MySwimPro, really happy I picked up swimming, this app makes it easy."
295,5,"What an amazing job this application really does cover everything you can 
network with other people and monitor your swimming calories distances and 
the duration which you choose to accomplish your goals everything is 
monitored and logged I love this app"
296,1,doesn't work with Apple
297,1,...go premium...waste of time!
298,5,"Maybe it is the best app for swimmers. I use as diary of trains, source of 
ideas for workouts (and completely workouts), swimming lessons and much 
more! Highly recommend!"
299,4,"Just wish there was another stroke available in the free app to really 
decide if it's worth purchasing. Enjoying the freestyle workouts so far tho"
300,3,"Free trial doesn't last long enough to be able to actually use. Monthly fee 
is also too high. Half that and I would subscribe."
301,1,Can't access without paying. Wasted my time.
302,1,"You have to pay for everything, not worth it."
303,1,I couldn't access anything without paying
304,5,It's great
305,5,Checking it out!
306,2,"This would be a great app if it had a few more training options that were free. You have to pay for everything. This is an app for serious swimmers that compete, not those of us who like to swim to stay fit and don't want to pay $15 per month to do so."
307,5,I love the simplicity and the structure of the workouts for beginnings in MySwimPro. I have improved my fitness goals by adding new exercises throughout my freestyle routine. I enjoy having the option to manual adjust the workouts depending on my ability. I've improved my freestyle time and will be training for a 70.3 triathlon.
308,5,Pretty good tool. Great swim programmes.ability to add own programmes.  Join the Facebook group and get added benefits
309,3,"I didn't like how I had to pay for additional resources. They offered basic information, anything more I would had to pay."
310,4,Lots of content here. Fun tips and serious training.
311,1,"I would happily pay for premium if the app was even half as good as the 
iPhone version."
312,5,Im really grateful for this app it has made me know alot about swimming & everyday is a nee adventure plus challenge ...i love it
313,5,Best swimming app in the world ;) a must for every swimmer out there!
314,1,"First, the best way to get better is with a team and or coach. I was not able to get any refund after I decided to cancel my subscription on the first day after the free trial ended. So now I have paid $100 for a year, and not the app will not allow me to access any of the workouts."
315,4,It says error loading data when I open the app
316,5,Amazing
317,1,Free is useless
318,4,Had some chances to try it. Logging is easy and quite convenient. I'm missing some options though. For instance it's impossible to log a combined set like kick-drill or kick-drill-swim. Or 100 free/50 stroke. The only option remains to write description. Also sync with USMS times doesn't work on my device (pixel xl) - gives me an error.
319,4,Some great workouts and variety.  I'd like to be able to change the measurement from yards to metres I'm not sure how to do that?
320,2,Its pretty cool so far but the tip videos won't play.
321,5,Great app. Also great and fast customer service. Had an issue and it was sorted very quickly.
322,1,Could even get it to launch on my device
323,1,"Don't advertise yourself as free in the app store if you are not free. For those who are reading this the app is $7.99 a month.  The app doesn't tell you until you create an account and custom your profile.  It's a huge waste of time. You do all this only for it to tell you... Now the next step is to select what kind of membership you want.  The cheapest option is $7.99 a month.  NO PHONE APP SHOULD COST THAT MUCH!  Responding to your comment: HA! That's a scam if I ever saw one.  I'm willing to bet your ""free trial"" required a credit card... And that it's next to impossible to end, thus, you end up getting charged. Does that sound about right."
324,2,Good but hard to cancel.  Signed up for the free month.  Tried to cancel and reach out to customer service.  It seems like this company is one guy on a WordPress site with awesome and helpful videos
325,1,Horrible couldn't figure out how stop being a member. And it doesn't work without internet
326,1,Its not joing me in the one month free demo.
327,3,"I think it's a good idea, decent app. I  believe it's too expensive to see the trainings tho! 100$ a year is too much. Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.   I'd suggest asking for times or usual swimming trainings and then the app could actually suggest times/distances according to that? Now that I'd pay for."
328,2,"I used to love this app, but it's been 2 months that I've been unable to use it, despite bug reports and updating the app whenever available. Please keep the all from crashing. I loved this app."
329,5,Awesome for tracking your progress
330,5,Easy to use and helpful I'm keeping track of workouts
331,5,Awesome!!! Good for jr.National sets
332,1,"I just want to track my swimming workouts.  This app looks like it can't let me do this simple task.  Clunky app with lots of colour and stupid words of encouragement.   I don't need an app to convince me to swim or tell me swimming's ""hidden"" benefits.  Deleting it now."
333,1,You have to pay for watching videos? Common. .
334,5,This app really motivates you to swim as hard as you can.
335,5,Best app for swimmers
336,5,Love
337,3,"I also would like a weight tracker with graph, km or Miles and to modify the time it takes to swim a workout. No beginner can swim that fast, even a former competitive swimmer like me. It would also be nice to log other types of workouts like yoga etc. Pros: the videos I watched were pretty good, not always the right video in the right place. Easy to use and learn. Like the custom workout feature. Give it a try but be prepared it may cost you for the features you want."
338,5,"This app is a must for any swimmer, its the best it has video's, and tips that can really help a swimmer on thier game a d also we can log in our time and work out."
339,5,Easy to use and great routines. Totally worth the $10 upgrade.
340,3,"After more than 9 months of use, all of my data - all of my logged swims - are gone. Very upsetting. Update: The developers were able to find and restore my data.I'm really impressed with their customer service for a free app. Great guys. Based on the incredible effort they made to get my swim data back, I've added 2 stars to my review."
341,5,I love it!
342,1,It say signup failed after it took my subscription and there is no way to cancel it from google app store
343,5,I love the design of this app. One of the best fitness apps I've ever used!
344,5,Very good workout
345,5,I really enjoy the refresh button. I can spend hours poolside refreshing the tabbed fragments. It's definitely my favorite feature in any app I've ever encountered. How did you make that? Did you build that with any parts from Android's sdk? Anyway I'm stoked about that refresh water drop. I feel I must clone it. Excellent work.
346,5,The best swimming app in the google play store by far.  Very user friendly.  Just keep swimming.
347,5,Excellent
348,5,Been using it since it came out and it has really become an amazing app.
349,4,Is there anyway to get longer distances or have it so you can pick a distance and it calculates a work out. There are times where I swim 7 or 8 miles at a time.  Thanks
350,4,"The app is great for taking a record of your training, too bad need pay to premium and have a little problems in the resume of your trainings nothing too bad it is OK"
351,5,I think it will be more usefull if can add callories gain.
352,3,Why ask people to pay for membership for this king of features? Everyone would much prefer a single in app purchase to unlock the pro version of this app. It's a shame because the app itself is great.
353,4,Fancy and handy. Just improve statistics and then it's perfect!
354,5,"Awesome app, the only missing part is stop watch so i have to manually log in but otherwise great great app :)"
355,5,Very good boi
356,5,Just started using this app properly and was surprised by the calibre of information available. The videos are very informative and the drills have really helped develop my technique. Overall great app for improving your swimming
357,5,Been using this app for a couple weeks now. Having a set workout everyday is a great motivator and all the organization aspects are a excellent plus.
358,5,The best coaching available ...  this is what i have been looking for ... !! U should really download it ...
359,5,Use full
360,5,Hundreds of workouts for everybody
361,5,It's like your own personal coach in your pocket. Great workouts and I can't wait to start using this to get back into shape. I've swam for years and even at the college level but I have been out of it for a while now so having an app full of workouts will make it easy to get back in the water with so many great practices to pick from.
362,5,"I'm a huge fan of this well designed app! I've been able to keep better track of my swimming workouts, even motivating myself to swim more! Highly recommended!"
363,5,If you go to the pool and sometimes can't figure out a workout on the top of your head. This app is for you. Just pick your swimming  level pick what you want to work on and your workout and you are off to the races. The best part is they give you links to YouTube videos of the drills you should be doing in the workout. :)
364,4,"Hello guys, first of all your app is sick, thanks! I am a beginner and I am not aware of ""pull"" term in the workouts. Is it refering to ""pull-outs""? Thanks in advance for your assistance."
365,4,Hi just installed the app(looks pretty slick :) ) but what does drill mean? I mean I am familiar with the concept kf a drill but which particular drill is meant??
366,5,This app made it easy for me to keep track of my training. The layout is also very cool and made me excited about fitness.
367,5,I love this app! I've tried a few apps before and the simplicity of this amazing
368,5,Offers a variety of structured swimming sets to help keep you in shape and on track to reaching your goals.
369,5,It only need one thing... Google fit integration...
370,5,"I can swim way ,way much better now"
371,5,I don't understand the numbers is that the estimated time to complete the set or the rest time ???
372,5,Awesome sauce!
373,5,"This app has a great, easy-to-use interface. Whether you are a seasoned veteran swimmer, or relatively a novice, this app can help you improve your swimming abilities by allowing you to track your own workout performance."
374,5,Dedicated swimmer here and this is just what I have been looking for to help me organize and track my workouts. Love how easy it is to use.
375,5,Simple and easy. Nothing too fancy and it does exactly what I need. Thanks to this group for understanding their user
376,3,"It has great potential. I like the training videos, there needs to be more of these. I'm not sure what 'descend 1-4' etc means, or 'just make'? You should also be able to select a workout based solely on strokes, distance or time, as sometimes you're time or stroke restricted. Breaststroke hurts my knee, so an option to auto design a workout based on stroke preference would be good. I like other users idea of a user database. It would definitely extend the usability of this app 10 fold."
377,4,As a swimmer I find this app very useful and very easy to understand. However it would be awesome if the app could also give you dryland work outs to help strength your stroke.
378,1,What is IM? What is 'KICK'? Descriptions please!!!  Unusable otherwise!!!
379,5,"Great and fast support, and an. amazing app overall!"
380,5,"There are so few swimming apps out there, this is definitely one of the best. I feel like it will just get better over time, can't wait for the updates."
381,5,Makes it easy to track laps and different kinds of swimming techniques
382,5,Great for swim coaches!
383,5,Awesome app. I agree with having a section to submit your own workouts. A database of user submitted workouts and category tags would be awesome.
384,5,"It is a fantastic app, I just wish you were able to submit your own workouts. Essentially making a database for younger coaches."
385,5,"I would like to see even more levels of customization (workouts by stroke focus, sprinter vs distance, etc)"
386,2,"I got this app to use with my Fitbit Iconic (which SUCKS). However, this app advertises it's available but it doesn't actually sync. Only the daily workouts are available on the Iconic. ALSO, the videos never open and it constantly freezes my phone. I've restarted, uninstalled and reinstalled. For $15.00/this app is ridiculous and a waste."
387,5,"This is the best swimming app I've downloaded by far. The workouts are clear, the interface is easy to use, and it allows me to keep track of all my swimming workouts! I just upgraded to premium and I'm really excited about the new content and advanced analytics. 10 out of 10 would download!"
388,5,"Love this app, I used to swim competitively (actually with / against the creator), and this has been a great tool for getting back in shape. Keep up the good work guys!"
389,4,"I like it, it has excellent trainings, but it could explain more some of the exercises. For example in back technique, 15 underwater per wall, i can imagine what it's, but it has no video or explanation."
390,5,"Its the best app for FREE, for swim sets around. I cant wait until you guys come up with a large variety of sets, maybe some submitted by other people? But so far, its great!!!"
391,1,Too complicated.  I just wanted to keep record of lengths swum  calories burned etc . Could not work it out .
392,1,"So unhappy all my PB's are in here and I can not log in thanks to the 
Twitter bit on the login working on my iPhone and Android, however when 
this app works it is a great app please fix soon as I need my times 😣😞😤"
393,2,Most of the functions are locked unless you pay money. The advanced setting is too easy if you're a regional or national level competitive swimmer.
394,5,Zero the only reason I gave you zero one because of your polite reply is because I don't use applications but I feel like you deserve a five for your prompt response
