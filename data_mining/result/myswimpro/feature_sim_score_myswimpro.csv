0,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.2552985
1,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.2771765
2,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.96686226
3,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.2552985
4,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.2552985
5,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.96686226
6,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.2552985
7,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",0.96686226
8,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.2552985
9,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.2552985
10,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.96686226
11,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9696647
12,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.",0.31073314
13,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  
Please respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.

14,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it. 

I can’t wait to see what goals I hit from now til winter! And I love that you can use GPS for free open water swim or put in how long your pool is. I also can’t wait to do this at the beach!",0.2552985
15,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am at 67 a new swimmer . I cannot begin to explain the benefit that this app and the outstanding customer support has bestowed to me. I started out needing to rest after 25 meters . Going to the pool to swim was a source of anxiety and I went because I knew it was in my best interest. Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training .

Go ahead , I dare you !",0.96686226
16,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.96686226
17,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.26811633
18,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.2552985
19,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",0.2552985
20,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.2552985
21,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.9758078
22,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.38897115
23,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.2552985
24,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.2552985
25,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved. 

I recently had an issue with my account and the customer service was on point. I got an immediate response and my issue was resolved with that one response. Keep up the great work, MySwimPro!",0.85631543
26,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.2552985
27,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.2552985

Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored.

I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data.

But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming. I’ve lost more weight than I thought I could, I’m swimming faster now than when I was a kid and I feel like I’m apart of a community. This app really changed my life for the better.",0.96686226
31,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.2552985
32,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I really do like this app. I love that it gives analytics on distance per stroke. I wear an Apple
Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.9879056
34,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.2552985

I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

37,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee.

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

301,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.96686226

366,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.97272646
367,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.2552985
368,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.96686226
369,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.2753824
370,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.96686226
371,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.98289734

I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.96951294
373,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.97390306

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

486,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.2552985

490,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.2552985
491,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.2552985

496,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.96686226

The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.94823456

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.94823456
523,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.95173657

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.94823456
529,Personalized swim Training Plans,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change.

531,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.9595433
534,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.44799784

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.31757072
536,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

Time seems to fly by now in the pool.  My technique and fitness are very clearly improving and I am enjoying the global MSP community tremendously.   I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.  Thank you SO much My Swim Pro!,0.94823456
561,Personalized swim Training Plans,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

tl;dr. this app is only for swimmers who are primarily concerned with lap times and who don’t have a team and are willing to pay for a pretty expensive app.",0.31757072
562,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. 

The latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. 

No matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!",0.9963096
563,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’m done with this app. Don’t get me wrong this app is great and I’ve loved using it as I’ve gotten back into swimming. However somehow I got logged out of my account and couldn’t remember the password I used when I first set up the app. I’ve requested several password resets over the course of a week and have not received one in my inbox, spam, or junk folders. I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.",0.95190245
564,Personalized swim Training Plans,"My sister and I have taken up swimming in our 40’s after many years of running injuries. We grew up in Florida so we could swim before we could walk but never swam on a team.  We initially joined a Adult Summer swim league and had a blast!! We wanted to continue through the fall and winter and build up our endurance, strength and work on technique. The app makes this so easy as it has the workouts already planned for us we just bring our phone to the pool in the waterproof case and voila.",0.94823456
565,Personalized swim Training Plans,"First off I’m just starting off swimming and have used the app once with my watch and it seems to have done what I was hoping it would do.  I’m not a sophisticated swimmer so I can’t comment on all the analytics etc. 

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. 

Well you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.",0.9909421
566,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season. This app’s workout structure is varied, purposeful, and expertly crafted - couldn’t ask for better. Also, in general, one of the best UI/UX designs in a fitness app I’ve ever used. If you swim or previously swam competitively in high school/college, get this app.",0.95149463
567,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Meh. It’s ok. Downloaded it for the drill/kick set mode. That part is fine. I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements). Lots of great potential here but a lot to be desired…maybe in time it’ll improve. At least I didn’t spend money on it.",0.9983499

Prior to the recent update it was great, I’m not a pro swimmer so the basic features do just fine. Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming. I cleared the cache on my phone & watch, restarted the watch and it still doesn’t work right.

571,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.51092935
572,Personalized swim Training Plans,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.9992232
573,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Not only is this the best fitness app I’ve used, it might be one of the best apps I’ve ever used period. I’ve gone from swimming with no plan or intent to doing structured workouts and have improved immensely in only a couple weeks. The Apple Watch app can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly. I love the short videos they provide on technique as well. Highly recommend if you’re serious about improving your swimming!",0.37356052
574,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.9570141

All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",0.9513951

I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.3478864
577,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.94823456
578,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Up until this summer, I was able to create a simple workout and that was good for me - I know my times, I’m not looking to win medals or meets, but just wanted something that tracks workouts and tells me when to push off the wall. Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable. Even if they’d have offered an inexpensive option to just make your own workouts, I could be on board, but this isn’t worth the hassle.",0.31757072
579,Personalized swim Training Plans,"UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$.

580,Personalized swim Training Plans,"After using for approx 3 months, 2-3 times a week I have to say, I am not happy. Around 40-45 minutes into any workout, randomly the watch app closes. And it’s not every time. Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank. Which means it didn’t record over to Strava or my health app on Apple. Overall I like it, which is why it got 3. But it is very frustrating to find the app closed after a workout is not quite done.",0.8947907
581,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.31757072
582,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

Only way it’s possible is to dry your hands and the watch every time. My suggest is being able to double click the crown button or side button to switch reps. I think this is a pretty big pit fall which is why I gave 3 stars. Otherwise it’s a great app.,0.32863808
615,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I love this app, it makes swimming fun and I look forward to using it every day. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it does not keep track of my lap times very well which in turn messes up the swolf score, my best times and lap splits, etc. That being said, I have tried the available swim apps and this is still the best swim app out there!",0.58667034
616,Personalized swim Training Plans,I love this app! As a swimmer this app is super user friendly and simple. I don’t have the premium version but the free routines they have are still good quality. I also love that you can make your own personal workout and track it. The only thing I wish for is more free routines. But besides that I love everything about this app.,0.8507905
617,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As a swimmer there are many things you need to know, watch, learn, practice and count. Having a coach was something that helped but had limitations especially if you change countries and travel. Since I started with MySwimPro I felt the best professional coach I can ask for is back with me always whenever I need it.",0.9971028
618,Personalized swim Training Plans,MySwimPro sets the ‘gold standard’.   I’ve hesitated to write a review until I really put this app thru it’s paces. It has been almost 4 years  since I started using MySwimPro.   Communication with there team is excellent.  The diversity of workouts is endless and there are training plans for every need from the beginner to the triathlete or masters swimmer.,0.38442454
619,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

* Initially Garmin sync would reset itself every time I entered “Account Settings”. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get that working as expected.

It’s a real pity as pool swimming can be quite monotonous without a coaching aspect.",0.31757072
620,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I have been using the app since it was launched. Today I use it to measure pace, etc. I utilize the sync/import my workouts feature for the most part. However since the last couple of updates, they have come through broken. My 200s come through as 25s, 75s…even though when I look at them in the iOS Fitness app they are tracking together. Please take a look. Thx",0.95235634
621,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I encountered some issues that stopped the app from working at one point.  Thankfully, installing the most recent version fixed them.

The app makes it reasonably easy to write up and execute your own workouts.  Times recorded are not very accurate, but that may be more a function of the Apple watch than the app - each swim may be off by several seconds.",0.33000836
622,Personalized swim Training Plans,"It is a good app with good plans. I use it most every day. The biggest issue is it doesn’t work with high end Garmin watches to export swim plans although it sells this as a feature. I have the MK1 and integrating between the app and devices is so complicated and never works. Even their customer service team could t figure it out.  

This also isn’t a product for people on a budget. You can find so many free workouts online. So it’s good but could be great. Just do your research.",0.31757072

624,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I have a Garmin watch and I can’t see any benefits of using the free app, the info appears to be about the same you get for free with your watch app. It seems the Apple Watch features are great for doing workouts in the pool. However, there are no free workouts, everything has to be paid for, even stuff that is free on their website and the price is really ridiculous if you just want the workouts. May be worth it if there is actually a proper coaching strategy but not sure that’s the case, didn’t even go for their free trial. Deleted.",0.31757072
625,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I was in the process of completing one of the training plans when I took a 6 week break for vacation.

I emailed support through the app and received instantaneous responses fixing the issue in a matter of moments. Love this app!!!",0.9518923
626,Personalized swim Training Plans,I have been using the app a few months and have actually switched to an annual subscription due to the value I gained from it. It is the next best thing to having a live coach and their customer service is the best I have seen from any app developer. Definitely a smart investment for any level swimmer.,0.33253357
627,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I love all the features of this app and it truly is top notch. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is unreasonably high. I understand the amount of work and the excellence that went into this, but it doesn’t serve people who need an app like this that is reasonably affordable. I already pay a gym membership premium. Having this would be excellent for training, but would be like adding an additional gym membership to my budget. 
If the subscription is ever lowered substantially, count me in!",0.3271577
628,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do. It also forces me to do the sets at the correct training paces. I highly recommend it for anyone unable to join a team.",0.89862275
629,Personalized swim Training Plans,The workouts are not challenging or tailored to my performance—annoying since the app has spent nearly 2 years collecting my data. The videos and various workouts can all be found (better) on the internet. Hardly worth $119. You’ll also receive all sorts of emails and “training” videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they’re in a partnership with—like a $200 device to build lung capacity. This may be helpful for beginners but if you’re an intermediate or above swimmer it’s not worth the money.,0.31757072
630,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I downloaded this app with high hopes. Unfortunately I encountered multiple issues right from the start, and eventually gave up and deleted it. 

After downloading the app to my phone and registering, I tried to open the app on my watch. It didn’t recognize that I had registered on my phone and wouldn’t move past the login screen. I had to restart my watch for it to log in. 

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. 

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout. 

3 restarts in the first 10 min of using the app. Don’t waste your time.",0.9518371
631,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I can’t advise this enough - RUN and do not do the trial. I didn’t remember signing up for a year subscription, just a 7 day trial that would result in a monthly fee after. I was automatically charged $100 after 7 days. I stopped using the app after the first swim, as it shuts off my Apple Watch ability to track data using Apple Health. I cannot find a customer support number anywhere, even though they promise their “premium” members ample support. More like endless links to wiki articles with no human in sight. Don’t make this mistake folks. This is a fraudulent app.",0.95288825
632,Personalized swim Training Plans,"When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.",0.33273238
633,Personalized swim Training Plans,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.32885593
634,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Getting to connect is difficult, and keeping connected even more. I have an Ionic, I loaded a workout last night, tried to use it this morning and it was fine, had to leave the pool to go get the phone to load it again. Then the app would not work because it the watch was not connected to the phone (had synchronized a minute before). Finally, I got the workout in, dis the workout and the data never made it to Fitbit dashboard. I also have an Apple Watch, I’m gonna test it with it, if it doesn’t work I’m deleting this app, so far not worth the money.",0.32829234
635,Personalized swim Training Plans,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,0.85739195
636,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The app looks great there are a lot of workout options and I liked the layout inside the workouts…when I could see it. Which brings me to why I’m giving it 3 stars, 99.9% of the app is behind a pay wall and it’s expensive. To pay for it on top of the gym membership to access the pool is not worth it. Especially since it doesn’t even sync with my smart watch (Fitbit).",0.32730183
637,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",0.33363104
638,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I usually don’t leave reviews but really wanted to support the guys building MySwimPro. My swimming has taken off since I started using the app on my Watch.

But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well.

655,Personalized swim Training Plans,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.33820528

I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

693,Personalized swim Training Plans,Great App. I synch it up with my Apple Watch and it delivers my workout set by set. There is always a workout of the day (WOD) and if that does not work for you there are plenty of others to choose from. Upgraded to Elite after a month of using the free App. Worth every penny!,0.3350556

695,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Way too expensive. The free version is so limited it nearly worthless. Need a $5 one time purchase version with ability to create more than 5 workouts.

This app is not so refined, nor is it intuitive.  Hopefully a developer comes up with abetter one.",0.33011064
723,Personalized swim Training Plans,I really like what this app has the possibility of doing but unfortunately it’s not there yet.

724,Personalized swim Training Plans,Loved the stats and the workouts available but has anyone else had an issue of the app not being able to close? When I was done swimming I went to hit finish and it wouldn’t let me. Ended up closing it out but it would keep reopening. Had to delete it eventually just so the app would stop.,0.95364755
725,Personalized swim Training Plans,All it does is provide an ad for the subscription services the offer. Click on anything within the app and you get an ad to upgrade to Pro.

I used to pretend that the logged swims were accurate because I was so ready to support this app.  After a year of completely inaccurate results  with no improvement I’ve decided that this review was necessary.  I’m very critical because I am software rengineer and I wold be ashamed to release such a piece of garbage.,0.9521125
730,Personalized swim Training Plans,Unless you pay for the subscription which I can’t afford as it’s way to pricy you can’t do anything in the app. There are claims you get 5 workouts but every workout is locked it’s a huge scam. I don’t care how helpful it could be putting everything behind a paywall despite what is promised in the free use of the app is a scam.,0.3276932
731,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The app is a pretty good coach, but in terms of tracking swimming when paired with a Fitbit Versa and an iPhone 8.... it’s garbage.

Don’t bother.

Even tried the advanced “up-sell”, still nothing.

Update: Based on Reading over reviews, it seems like this company is more interested in appearing helpful than actually making a product that functions properly.

Do you know how much money and employees they must dedicate to troubleshoooting? Have you ever seen another review where the developer has tried so hard (with robot responses) to seem like they care.

813,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.94823456

878,Personalized swim Training Plans,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9556028
879,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.31757072
880,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.94823456
881,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.33725312
882,Personalized swim Training Plans,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.94823456
883,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9927845

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9515461

997,Personalized swim Training Plans,App is just waste of time and money.,0.586082
998,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.31757072
999,Personalized swim Training Plans,This app is cool.,0.4562476
1000,Personalized swim Training Plans,THIS APP IS DOPE!,0.45969763
1001,Personalized swim Training Plans,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.3968216
1002,Personalized swim Training Plans,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.31757072
1003,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.31757072

1006,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I started swimming 4 years ago at the age of 50 and stumbled upon this app through the YouTube videos that taught me how to swim. For 2+ years I put off paying the “extra” money for the coaching and other features available. Now that I did purchase the coaching, I have ZERO regrets. My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational.

1008,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.94823456
1009,Personalized swim Training Plans,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts!

But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try.

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.1637103
1029,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9865084

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.1637103

It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.1637103

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.9865084

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.1637103

1325,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9865084

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.99016273
1391,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.1637103
1392,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9865084

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9613541

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

1514,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.1637103
1515,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.1637103

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps.

1520,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9865084

Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.

The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.97830266

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode.

1552,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.97830266
1553,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself.

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change.

1555,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.3429452

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.20718077
1560,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.40939552
1596,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome).

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.23852001
1601,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

1605,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.20718077
1606,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

1837,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.97830266

1902,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9830055
1903,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.20718077
1904,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.97830266
1905,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book.

I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.97258985

2022,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

2026,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.20718077
2027,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.20718077

2032,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.97830266

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.

But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.65542895

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.75525683
2053,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.65542895

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

2067,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.84006554

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.75525683

It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Unfavorable characteristics:

I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

2107,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.8767897
2108,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.8806985

The Apple Watch app can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly. I love the short videos they provide on technique as well.

2110,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.6769765

I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.77593446
2113,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.65542895

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank.

2117,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.75525683
2118,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

You’ll also receive all sorts of emails and “training” videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they’re in a partnership with—like a $200 device to build lung capacity.

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. 

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout.

2349,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.65542895

2414,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.6734158
2415,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.75525683
2416,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.65542895

I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.91604996

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

2538,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.75525683
2539,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.75525683

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps.

2544,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.65542895

Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.63888276

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route.

Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training .

2576,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.63888276
2577,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself.

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.7693041
2579,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

2582,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.85164154

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.7693041
2584,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved.

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored.

But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

2597,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. 

Well you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.",0.7717036

I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season.

I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming.

It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.8870198

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.7894426

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

2629,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.7693041

Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

* Initially Garmin sync would reset itself every time I entered “Account Settings”. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get that working as expected.

2861,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.63888276

2926,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.65721244
2927,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.7693041
2928,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.63888276

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.90712965

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

3046,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.7693041

3050,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.7693041
3051,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.7693041

3056,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.63888276

The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure.

And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday.

It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

3077,Build your own custom workouts,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.14609902

My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.14609902
3089,Build your own custom workouts,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself.

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change.

3091,Build your own custom workouts,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

3094,Build your own custom workouts,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.9999862

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.98927

You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.98927

3373,Build your own custom workouts,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.14609902

3438,Build your own custom workouts,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.1698653
3439,Build your own custom workouts,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.98927
3440,Build your own custom workouts,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming.

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.14609902

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.556354

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.98927

3560,Build your own custom workouts,THIS APP IS DOPE!,0.99996907
3561,Build your own custom workouts,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.99809474
3562,Build your own custom workouts,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.98927
3563,Build your own custom workouts,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.98927

3568,Build your own custom workouts,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.14609902
3569,Build your own custom workouts,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall.

Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don’t need nor want the coaching help.

The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose.

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure.

And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

3589,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.06702682

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.9977512

It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.9977512

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

3621,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$.

3653,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.9977512

3885,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.06702682

3950,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.091020115
3951,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.9977512
3952,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.06702682
3953,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.9989308

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.4885654

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.9977512

4073,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data",VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.99984145
4074,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9977512
4075,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9977512

4080,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.06702682

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.25453323

It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.967064
4099,Drill & technique video library,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

4100,Drill & technique video library,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.25453323
4101,Drill & technique video library,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.967064
4102,Drill & technique video library,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

4118,Drill & technique video library,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.38824195
4119,Drill & technique video library,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.25453323
4120,Drill & technique video library,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.25453323

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored.

4127,Drill & technique video library,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

4133,Drill & technique video library,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$.

4165,Drill & technique video library,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.25453323

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

4309,Drill & technique video library,All it does is provide an ad for the subscription services the offer. Click on anything within the app and you get an ad to upgrade to Pro.

4397,Drill & technique video library,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.967064

4462,Drill & technique video library,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.97290975
4463,Drill & technique video library,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.25453323
4464,Drill & technique video library,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.967064
4465,Drill & technique video library,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.27462152
4466,Drill & technique video library,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.967064
4467,Drill & technique video library,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9827513
4468,Drill & technique video library,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9697066
4469,Drill & technique video library,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.9740824
4470,Drill & technique video library,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.26436427

There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.2667679

When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute.

4582,Drill & technique video library,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.25453323
4583,Drill & technique video library,This app is cool.,0.39674884
4584,Drill & technique video library,THIS APP IS DOPE!,0.40030828
4585,Drill & technique video library,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.3356075
4586,Drill & technique video library,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.25453323
4587,Drill & technique video library,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.25453323

4592,Drill & technique video library,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.967064

This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.17211573
4610,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.9887293
4611,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.14971423
4612,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.14971423
4613,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9887293
4614,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are.

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.14971423

I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim.

4644,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.14971423
4645,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

4909,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9887293

1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9920461
4975,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.14971423
4976,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9887293
4977,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.17027654
4978,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.9887293
4979,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.95735615
4980,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.99026006
4981,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.9926785
4982,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it's totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!",0.9912319
4983,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.15977122
4984,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.16223186
4985,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance. If you can eventually make it stay on the screen, there is no way to end and log your workout; the time keeps going and it says ""Ending workout..."" until you delete the app and reinstall it.",0.16488184
4986,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything. I love using this app as it tracks my swimming but, the update has made it stressful and annoying.",0.64898014
4987,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming. I love that I can track my progress, pick from a variety of sets, and customize my workouts to my ability.  The videos are helpful, especially for those just getting into swimming.  The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.9904862
4988,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"But I do wish there was a place to put the desired workout time.

4989,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I swim once a week. I'm a pool scrub, 800m and I'm toast. Working on getting better and looking for an app to help. This does with some videos and other training sundries. Unfortunately 80% of the app is behind a subscribe monthly wall which is far outside my appetite.

Also some bugs in editing swims. No matter what I edit. It saves the default program unless it is custom from the ground up. 

Good stats screen and glad to see something enter the arena but the pricing model will eventually push me away.",0.9290002

4991,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I just started back swimming laps and using my new Apple Watch. I like the features of my swim pro, it does show the different strokes. I usually swim 200 yd sets. 200 free, 200 back then 200 breast. How do I get the app to register the different strokes. If I swim without stopping at the end of a set, the app reports free. I have tried to pause between sets, then the app stops and doesn't register the next set. The app has even gone inactive and not recorded the session.",0.9933253
4992,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I'm a lifeguard and at my job we are required to swim a lot. I  try to swim more so I can increase my strokes and to stay fit. This is a great app!

Highly recommend.",0.99105364
4994,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I have high hopes for this app.  Would love to see the option to input my 100yd base interval.  The selection of beginner, intermediate, advanced seems too broad a bucket and I have no way of knowing if the workout intervals are designed for lots of rest or if I should manually drop the times.  Having heart rate data is great, but would like to see that used to help coach the appropriate workouts and intervals.  Thanks!",0.95196146
4995,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"If I could rate the app for the watch part probably a solid 3.5 stars 4 when you factory in the possibilities under future updates. But the phone part of the app is just off NO METRICS for anything really if you use a garmin swim watch 920xt or better or anything like that you will be disappointed to not find any of your stoke count, swolf report, or even pace per individual interval... glad I could unsubscribe immediately.",0.14971423
4996,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I love this app! I use it if practice ever gets canceled. I'll write down the set, take it to the pool, and when I get back I log my swim!

4997,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Videos! Downloadable workouts! Stroke differentiation and auto-pause. Sure looks good and promises a lot. The problem is you can't actually start workouts from your Watch. Will hang indefinitely waiting for you to open one on your phone, which it won't recognize. Plus, the website is not optimized for mobile at all.

For 9.99, this app should be flawless. For the obscene subscription price of 9.99 a MONTH, having any issues at all is an insult.",0.14971423
4998,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I am a swimmer who was looking for an app that would help me improve and track all aspects of my performance and MySwimPro really delivered.

4999,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I did my first workout but where is my data?  Also it took about ten laps for it to start recording my laps accurately.  I have gone online to try to figure out how to sync the iwatch with the app on the iPhone - nice looking blog site but does not share anything about using the iwatch or the app.  The app on the iwatch was short on instructions so i had no idea how to end the workout or save it.,0.160833
5000,Compete in monthly swim challenges,Every single day I use this app it grows on me. Tracking workouts/stats/progress is very rewarding. Having followers helps drive accountability.

5001,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Was having problems with the app crashing, but that is fixed in most recent version of the app. Overall, I like the workouts and have seen improvements to my times using this app for training. 

Developers are pretty responsive and open to feedback. 

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

I'd love to see the app get smarter about rest time. If I always finish a set well below the suggested time then it should adjust.",0.14971423

5003,Compete in monthly swim challenges,It looks like all the pieces are here to benefit from integration with the Apple Watch series 2 but yet falls way short. Could only sink watch and app 1 x and couldn't even get work outs on the watch. Please fix the series 2 watch and app interface.

5006,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"It doesn't track your distance when you are kicking and doesn't account for long streamlines, so the distances end up off when you're done with a set, sometimes by quite a bit. My workouts are typically about 1,000 yards longer than the app indicates.

5094,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

5098,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.14971423
5099,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.14971423

5104,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9887293

This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout.

However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9238755

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route.

I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",0.9238755

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.3826931

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9281094

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

5137,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash.

5163,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This isn’t really a critique it’s more me asking if a feature could be added. I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well.

5164,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid. Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.,0.9280047
5165,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava.

5169,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

5211,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),I found the description to be a bit misleading for a free app. Yes the app is free but there is nothing you can do with out the paid subscription. I’m training for a triathlon and wanted a good resource to help with swimming workouts but the 7 day trial isn’t a long enough evaluation period for me to see if I want to spend $20/month on an subscription. I can track swimming on my Apple Watch so I don’t need the app without the premium features at all.

5218,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Been using for years and used to like it a lot. I understand the developers have to make money, but these days it’s quite annoying to use this app if you don’t need any to sign up for one of their paid subscriptions. It’s constantly barraging you to subscribe, make a training plain, etc. 

If you want to use this app as your coach it’s probably a good one. But if you just want to track your swimming activity, there are probably better options now.",0.3826931

I wish it was easier to filter the workouts by things like equipment or add dynamic adjustments to intervals when you miss some, but those are really minor gripes.

5222,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),Having to unlock the watch just to switch the reps is very difficult because there is water on the watch and that messes with the screen heavily.

5227,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

5235,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I love all the features of this app and it truly is top notch. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is unreasonably high. I understand the amount of work and the excellence that went into this, but it doesn’t serve people who need an app like this that is reasonably affordable. I already pay a gym membership premium.

5237,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),The workouts are not challenging or tailored to my performance—annoying since the app has spent nearly 2 years collecting my data. The videos and various workouts can all be found (better) on the internet. Hardly worth $119. You’ll also receive all sorts of emails and “training” videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they’re in a partnership with—like a $200 device to build lung capacity.

5421,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9238755

5486,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9328182
5487,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.3826931
5488,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9238755
5489,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.401854
5490,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.9238755
5491,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9987171

I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9278784

5606,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

5609,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.4596443
5610,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.3826931
5611,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.3826931

5616,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9238755

Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”.

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.35014087
5638,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

5933,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.35014087

5998,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.3725828

Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.93669707

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.7181145

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

6122,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.93669707
6123,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.93669707

6128,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

6445,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.1104088

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.1342965

It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.99388623
6635,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.99388623

6640,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.095976576

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

6957,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.095976576

7022,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.11990451
7023,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.9953836

The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

7146,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9953836
7147,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9953836

7152,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.095976576
7153,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them.

Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

7173,Track total distance swum,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.31294328

My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

7185,Track total distance swum,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.9497718

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.95934016

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.9497718

7283,Track total distance swum,"I love all the features of this app and it truly is top notch. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is unreasonably high. I understand the amount of work and the excellence that went into this, but it doesn’t serve people who need an app like this that is reasonably affordable. I already pay a gym membership premium.

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again.

7386,Track total distance swum,Unless you pay for the subscription which I can’t afford as it’s way to pricy you can’t do anything in the app. There are claims you get 5 workouts but every workout is locked it’s a huge scam.

Update: Based on Reading over reviews, it seems like this company is more interested in appearing helpful than actually making a product that functions properly.

7469,Track total distance swum,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.31294328

7534,Track total distance swum,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.33571064
7535,Track total distance swum,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.9497718
7536,Track total distance swum,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.31294328

I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

7539,Track total distance swum,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.6901223

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

7654,Track total distance swum,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.9497718
7655,Track total distance swum,This app is cool.,0.9859741
7656,Track total distance swum,THIS APP IS DOPE!,0.9866144
7657,Track total distance swum,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.97288436
7658,Track total distance swum,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9497718
7659,Track total distance swum,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9497718

7664,Track total distance swum,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.31294328
7665,Track total distance swum,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall.

The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features.

And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday.

However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.19227453

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

7749,View logged workouts on your profile,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.9813412

7981,View logged workouts on your profile,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.19227453

8046,View logged workouts on your profile,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.21583661
8047,View logged workouts on your profile,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.9813412
8048,View logged workouts on your profile,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.19227453

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.5946635

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.9813412

8170,View logged workouts on your profile,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9813412
8171,View logged workouts on your profile,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9813412

8176,View logged workouts on your profile,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.70710677

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

8196,Earn achievement badges,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.70710677

Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.70710677

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

8493,Earn achievement badges,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.70710677

8558,Earn achievement badges,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.7239198
8559,Earn achievement badges,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.70710677

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.70710677

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.94207555

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.70710677
8683,Earn achievement badges,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.70710677

8688,Earn achievement badges,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.70710677

This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure.

And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9789598

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode.

It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.9789598
8721,Follow friends,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself.

8723,Follow friends,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

9005,Follow friends,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9789598

9070,Follow friends,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9835872
9071,Follow friends,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.20405327
9072,Follow friends,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9789598
9073,Follow friends,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.9789598
9075,Follow friends,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9718418

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

9190,Follow friends,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.20405327

9192,Follow friends,THIS APP IS DOPE!,0.35225996
9193,Follow friends,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.28631786
9194,Follow friends,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.20405327
9195,Follow friends,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.20405327

9200,Follow friends,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9789598
