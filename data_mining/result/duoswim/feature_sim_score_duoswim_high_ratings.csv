0,personal AI coach,"Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It‚Äôs less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.
I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it‚Äôs for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.",0.927404
1,personal AI coach,"Finally a swim app that looks great and provides superb workouts. The recent addition of the swims and sprints feature has been very well received, and keeps you motivated to archive a goal distance. It would be fun to have additional functions like ‚Äúcreate your own workout‚Äù or ‚Äòrandom workout‚Äô. 

Overall, I am extremely impressed with the app and the integration with apple watch, functionally it is great. Having some extra metrics would be cool and badges on the profile, but this isn‚Äôt a priority. Thumbs up from me and 5 stars.",0.927404
2,personal AI coach,"This app is very easy to use. I love how you can send and sync workouts to your watch ‚Äì this can take a few tries, but I don‚Äôt fault DuoSwim for this since every phone-watch connected app has this problem. Swim workouts are tailored for all abilities from beginner swimmers to advanced. 

You can also log kick and drills on the apple watch when you choose an open goal swim, this is very useful to get the correct swim distance. Overall, a very promising app that has potential to be great! Great job guys! üèäüèäüëç",0.927404
3,personal AI coach,Perfect app. Used to love swimming but hadn‚Äôt regularly swam for many years. This app has helped me on a journey and I now look forward to my regular swims 3 times a week. Im working through the training plans and love the ease of recording sessions and the regular updates. Well done highly recommended to anyone wanting to get back in the pool or for those wanting professional detailed sessions.,0.927404
4,personal AI coach,"After trying a few apps for my swimming, the DuoSwim app is my favourite and less complicated to use than others. Honestly, I don‚Äôt find any issues with this app personally and like how new features are added regularly. Well done guys!",0.43137684
5,personal AI coach,"This is the first app I have found where I can have access to a variety of training sessions that I can follow to improve my swimming. The range of drills used in the sessions keeps it interesting.  A great addition to the app is the videos, this is perfect for visualising and learning skills. The training journey enables me to track my progress and the attention to detail to ensure you can see results is amazing. I love that there is inspiration for nutrition with recipes to try too! I recommend for anyone wanting to improve their swimming in any capacity.",0.927404
6,personal AI coach,Very nice app not so complicated as others. I will start my journey from tomorrow. It might be nice if you add a pdf format for the workouts. Just a suggestion really. Also as a master swimmer I would appreciate some plans based on ages/ability etc. As I purchased the gold membership it would be nice to add some more options for the nutrition section and maybe some advise for dry land exercises before swimming?

7,personal AI coach,"This app was exactly what I needed to start training more effectively and efficiently. I‚Äôve already started feeling more confident and motivated in the pool.

9,personal AI coach,"This app is quality, helping me build up my swimming skills and a lot cheaper than buying a coach every week that doesn‚Äôt even do as good a job. Fully recommend to anyone who wants to build endurance pace and swimming ability.",0.93274516

84,track your swims,"Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It‚Äôs less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.
I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it‚Äôs for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.",0.98771197
85,track your swims,"Finally a swim app that looks great and provides superb workouts. The recent addition of the swims and sprints feature has been very well received, and keeps you motivated to archive a goal distance. It would be fun to have additional functions like ‚Äúcreate your own workout‚Äù or ‚Äòrandom workout‚Äô. 

Overall, I am extremely impressed with the app and the integration with apple watch, functionally it is great. Having some extra metrics would be cool and badges on the profile, but this isn‚Äôt a priority. Thumbs up from me and 5 stars.",0.98771197
86,track your swims,"This app is very easy to use. I love how you can send and sync workouts to your watch ‚Äì this can take a few tries, but I don‚Äôt fault DuoSwim for this since every phone-watch connected app has this problem. Swim workouts are tailored for all abilities from beginner swimmers to advanced. 

You can also log kick and drills on the apple watch when you choose an open goal swim, this is very useful to get the correct swim distance. Overall, a very promising app that has potential to be great! Great job guys! üèäüèäüëç",0.98771197
87,track your swims,Perfect app. Used to love swimming but hadn‚Äôt regularly swam for many years. This app has helped me on a journey and I now look forward to my regular swims 3 times a week. Im working through the training plans and love the ease of recording sessions and the regular updates. Well done highly recommended to anyone wanting to get back in the pool or for those wanting professional detailed sessions.,0.98771197

89,track your swims,"This is the first app I have found where I can have access to a variety of training sessions that I can follow to improve my swimming. The range of drills used in the sessions keeps it interesting.  A great addition to the app is the videos, this is perfect for visualising and learning skills. The training journey enables me to track my progress and the attention to detail to ensure you can see results is amazing. I love that there is inspiration for nutrition with recipes to try too! I recommend for anyone wanting to improve their swimming in any capacity.",0.98771197
90,track your swims,Very nice app not so complicated as others. I will start my journey from tomorrow. It might be nice if you add a pdf format for the workouts. Just a suggestion really. Also as a master swimmer I would appreciate some plans based on ages/ability etc. As I purchased the gold membership it would be nice to add some more options for the nutrition section and maybe some advise for dry land exercises before swimming?
