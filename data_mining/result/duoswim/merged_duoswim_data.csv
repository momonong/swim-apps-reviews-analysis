"Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It’s less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.
I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it’s for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.",5,"Amazing app, some improvements needed",0.3340277777777778,0.6576388888888889,positive,personal AI coach,0.32577386

"Finally a swim app that looks great and provides superb workouts. The recent addition of the swims and sprints feature has been very well received, and keeps you motivated to archive a goal distance. It would be fun to have additional functions like “create your own workout” or ‘random workout’. 

Overall, I am extremely impressed with the app and the integration with apple watch, functionally it is great. Having some extra metrics would be cool and badges on the profile, but this isn’t a priority.

"Positive: The coaching side seems ok and decent price compared to others. Needs Improvement: Watch app The watch up has a very basic screen in pool swim mode. Only distance, time, heart rate and calories. Split time can’t be changed while swimming, you are stuck with it when you begin, need to be chosen. No time/100m etc available. Apple fitness integration. Pool swim recorded as open water swim in Apple Fitness. No detail on splits / sets available in Apple fitness. Just distance and heart rate during swim. So integration not working too well. iPhone application Coaching section looks ok but I’ve not tested it. There is only a high level summary available on swims: Distance, Duration, Pace (over whole session including rest), Calories, Average Heart Rate over whole session. So fairly useless to track how well one has done by set. Since I have a coach, cancelled subscription.
