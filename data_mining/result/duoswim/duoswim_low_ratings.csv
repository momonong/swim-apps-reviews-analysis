2,"Positive: The coaching side seems ok and decent price compared to others. Needs Improvement: Watch app The watch up has a very basic screen in pool swim mode. Only distance, time, heart rate and calories. Split time can’t be changed while swimming, you are stuck with it when you begin, need to be chosen. No time/100m etc available. Apple fitness integration. Pool swim recorded as open water swim in Apple Fitness. No detail on splits / sets available in Apple fitness. Just distance and heart rate during swim. So integration not working too well. iPhone application Coaching section looks ok but I’ve not tested it. There is only a high level summary available on swims: Distance, Duration, Pace (over whole session including rest), Calories, Average Heart Rate over whole session. So fairly useless to track how well one has done by set. Since I have a coach, cancelled subscription. Not useful for me.",2,"Watch app is very limited, integration apple fitness weak."
