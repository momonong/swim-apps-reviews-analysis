0,"Amazing app, amazing coach and superb courses. I am enjoying the app so much and it motivates me to go at least twice a week for swim. I find courses are very well made and help any aspiring swimmer at all levels. 
I used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. 
Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",5
1,Tried a few training apps for getting into swimming and this one is the best I‚Äôve seen. Tips are helpful and easy to understand,5
2,"I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach. After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it‚Äôs videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I‚Äôm impressed!",4
3,"Great app! Simple as it is, works good for beginners and pros as well! Just download this app, find a pool and get that practice done!",5
4,"They put me on 2 levels before champion but the workouts are way too easy. I also told the survey, I swim for 2 hrs and a minimum of 5000 yards. The training they give me is less than 2 hrs and WAY less than 5000 yards.",2
5,Thank you guys. Appreciate your work.,5
6,"I love Swimup‚Äôs YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It‚Äôs a nice minimalistic app that‚Äôs simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn‚Äôt there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup‚Äôs YouTube videos because of the explanations. It‚Äôs very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn‚Äôt live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",3
7,No voice tutorials makes these videos useless.,1
8,"I put my phone in a plastic bag to use this app. XD It's sleek and easy to use. I tried out the first 2 recommended workouts and liked them a lot, but now it won't generate any more and I don't have a subscription. Are there only 2 accessible workouts per mode without a subscription? Also some of the drill descriptions are hard to understand (in English). Not a huge problem but I'm not familiar with all the drills. (Edit: the videos are really helpful though!)",4
9,"The app is decent, I am using it, but the behavior in regards to sales is terrible, I have bought an yearly subscription at a very markdown price. Normally this should have locked in my subscription, instead I was refunded the money and forced to pay again because of new pricing. Buying a subscription means that it should be respected, if it was sold at a low price to gain customers, it means you made a conscious choice to loose money on initial marketing and leads.",3
10,"They are a great service to sort out what you might want to train up for in the swimming pool, the next thing I'd appreciate is if they could make some dry-land workout routines I could follow.",5
11,"A lot of potential and probably the best of the kind in many aspects, including usability. But it is very limited and it seems development is completely stagnant. No option to remove workouts, restart program, increase workout duration/length or chose which equipment you have. Also doesn't export/import from Garmin or Polar. Very disappointed. It would have so much potential if it wasn't abandoned...",2
12,"Great suppport service. I was unable to use the app due to a mistaken ""connection issue"". They fixed it right away, and I'm now the happiest guy in the pool with my app.",5
13,"The app is a great resource! But I'm only interested in the material, and not the device tracking features as I don't have one. Is it possible to make a cheaper plan to get access to all the resources?",5
14,"An excellent app. I've been following Swimup on YouTube since it was first created. Pin point error correction, solutions and excelent effective training ideas on adult swimming. Program includes all basic and all advance levels and END and SPRT modes with using tools where necessary. I made my subscription on 2021 August 1st. I took many private lessons and group work so far, but I have never had such a rapid and effective development until now. You must try, time is valuable.",5
15,"If only they got rid of those generic photos of that male swimmer from the start screen. And add some HD photos of Olympians, familiar faces for each category. This app would look immensely cleaner! Performance wise : the app won't save your work if you take a call or switch tabs from another app during your workout for some reason.",4
16,"Would rate five stars if we had the option to select what equipment is available to us and tailor the workouts around that. Ex: not swimming in a pool so unable to do exercises based on pushing off the wall, etc. Also would like to be able to select less than 250m and less than 20 min on the set up questionnaire for complete beginners.",4
17,"Very good content and presentation with clear explanations. The app experience could be a tiny bit more refined, but for what it does it's great. I use it in combination with Swim Coach.",4
18,Immediately impressed with the UI and build of the app. Excited to put in some work with this app.,5
19,"Great app so far, I just wish there was a way to reset your training plan and swim stats. I accidentally completed a workout I hadn't done yet, just wish I could undo those stats. Otherwise the app is super simple and dummy proof!",5
20,"Subscription schemes to bleed customers dry ad infinitum are the only option offered to obtain the software's full functionality; there is no possibility to purchase the program once and for all. Consequently, this milkingware has been replaced with an alternative that can be bought instead of rented and was subsequently uninstalled.",2
21,Great swimming app. Just wish there were exercises for pull buoys and snorkel. Taking off a star and uninstalling because you can't choose which strokes you'd like to focus on or what equipment you have (I'd like pull buoy and snorkel exercises).,4
22,"As a former swimmer with respectful results in junior competition in my country, i'm delighted by this phenomenal app! Now, i'm 33 years old and trying to rebuild my condition and maybe take part in veteran's competitions. This app is very helpful for me because it provides me daily with great workouts. Congratulations guys! One dilemma though - if i have for example 3x100m freestyle with 30 sec rest, does it means rest after each 100's or after i complete all 3? Thanks for answer in advance",5
23,"For beginners who want to learn swim better with strictured plan and drills, this is the app! It helps me a lot of improving my swimming techniques in short of time. Thanks!",5
24,"I wish I could print the exercises with more details. I started bringing my phone in a water bag and check the numbers in the pool, so I don't have to spend a lot of time memorizing them",4
25,The videod keep loading without opening,1
26,Absolutely loving it so far! I used to swim competitively and am now coming back to swimming as a form of working out. Exactly what I was looking for.,5
27,"It's a superb app,covered up for all round skills and techniques...an easy way to improve with lesser time",5
28,Coooooool. I like it but please improvise the ability to download the clips and use them when offline,5
29,This app did not meet my expectation. I have unsubscribed within a day and I am unable to get the refund.,1
30,"Excellent content, but - you must adding option for Android watches. Like garnim watch ( as competitors have ) . You have a lot users like my, with Android phones / watches, and this feature is necessary for exercises into the pool. Thank you !!",4
31,"Good videos with proper techniques, can we download videos if we take subscription of the app",4
32,It makes me feel like I have a one on one personal trainer. I love this app and have recommend it to my friends.,5
33,"Excellent application, helped me lot for learning and improving swimimg",5
34,"I make a subscription and app stop working , can't load anything eaven a free lesons",1
