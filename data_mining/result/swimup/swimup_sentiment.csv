"Amazing app, amazing coach and superb courses. I am enjoying the app so much and it motivates me to go at least twice a week for swim. I find courses are very well made and help any aspiring swimmer at all levels. 
I used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. 
Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",5,0.44615384615384623,0.5499999999999999,positive
Tried a few training apps for getting into swimming and this one is the best I’ve seen. Tips are helpful and easy to understand,5,0.41111111111111115,0.41111111111111115,positive
"I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach. After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it’s videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I’m impressed!",4,0.425,0.5,positive

"They put me on 2 levels before champion but the workouts are way too easy. I also told the survey, I swim for 2 hrs and a minimum of 5000 yards. The training they give me is less than 2 hrs and WAY less than 5000 yards.",2,0.033333333333333354,0.32222222222222224,positive

"I love Swimup’s YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It’s a nice minimalistic app that’s simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn’t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup’s YouTube videos because of the explanations. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn’t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",3,0.1666433566433566,0.7370879120879121,positive

"I put my phone in a plastic bag to use this app. XD It's sleek and easy to use. I tried out the first 2 recommended workouts and liked them a lot, but now it won't generate any more and I don't have a subscription. Are there only 2 accessible workouts per mode without a subscription? Also some of the drill descriptions are hard to understand (in English). Not a huge problem but I'm not familiar with all the drills. (Edit: the videos are really helpful though!)",4,0.1571969696969697,0.5439393939393941,positive
"The app is decent, I am using it, but the behavior in regards to sales is terrible, I have bought an yearly subscription at a very markdown price. Normally this should have locked in my subscription, instead I was refunded the money and forced to pay again because of new pricing. Buying a subscription means that it should be respected, if it was sold at a low price to gain customers, it means you made a conscious choice to loose money on initial marketing and leads.",3,-0.062389277389277395,0.43404428904428893,negative

"A lot of potential and probably the best of the kind in many aspects, including usability. But it is very limited and it seems development is completely stagnant. No option to remove workouts, restart program, increase workout duration/length or chose which equipment you have. Also doesn't export/import from Garmin or Polar. Very disappointed. It would have so much potential if it wasn't abandoned...",2,0.11653439153439152,0.6123015873015873,positive

"An excellent app. I've been following Swimup on YouTube since it was first created. Pin point error correction, solutions and excelent effective training ideas on adult swimming. Program includes all basic and all advance levels and END and SPRT modes with using tools where necessary. I made my subscription on 2021 August 1st. I took many private lessons and group work so far, but I have never had such a rapid and effective development until now. You must try, time is valuable.",5,0.2625,0.5694444444444444,positive
"If only they got rid of those generic photos of that male swimmer from the start screen. And add some HD photos of Olympians, familiar faces for each category. This app would look immensely cleaner!

"Would rate five stars if we had the option to select what equipment is available to us and tailor the workouts around that.

Great swimming app. Just wish there were exercises for pull buoys and snorkel. Taking off a star and uninstalling because you can't choose which strokes you'd like to focus on or what equipment you have (I'd like pull buoy and snorkel exercises).,4,0.8,0.75,positive
"As a former swimmer with respectful results in junior competition in my country, i'm delighted by this phenomenal app! Now, i'm 33 years old and trying to rebuild my condition and maybe take part in veteran's competitions. This app is very helpful for me because it provides me daily with great workouts. Congratulations guys! One dilemma though - if i have for example 3x100m freestyle with 30 sec rest, does it means rest after each 100's or after i complete all 3?
