"Amazing app, amazing coach and superb courses. I am enjoying the app so much and it motivates me to go at least twice a week for swim. I find courses are very well made and help any aspiring swimmer at all levels. 
I used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. 
Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",5,Amazing app,0.44615384615384623,0.5499999999999999,positive
Tried a few training apps for getting into swimming and this one is the best I’ve seen. Tips are helpful and easy to understand,5,Best swimming app,0.41111111111111115,0.41111111111111115,positive
"I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach. After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it’s videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I’m impressed!",4,Thank you!,0.425,0.5,positive

"They put me on 2 levels before champion but the workouts are way too easy. I also told the survey, I swim for 2 hrs and a minimum of 5000 yards. The training they give me is less than 2 hrs and WAY less than 5000 yards.",2,Honest oppinion of a 17 year old on a swim team,0.033333333333333354,0.32222222222222224,positive

"I love Swimup’s YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It’s a nice minimalistic app that’s simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn’t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup’s YouTube videos because of the explanations. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn’t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",3,"I really want to like the app, I really do",0.1666433566433566,0.7370879120879121,positive
