0,personalized training plans,"They put me on 2 levels before champion but the workouts are way too easy. I also told the survey, I swim for 2 hrs and a minimum of 5000 yards. The training they give me is less than 2 hrs and WAY less than 5000 yards.",0.94065195
1,personalized training plans,"I love Swimupâ€™s YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. Itâ€™s a nice minimalistic app thatâ€™s simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isnâ€™t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimupâ€™s YouTube videos because of the explanations. Itâ€™s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesnâ€™t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",0.93659395

No option to remove workouts, restart program, increase workout duration/length or chose which equipment you have. Also doesn't export/import from Garmin or Polar. Very disappointed. It would have so much potential if it wasn't abandoned...",0.35041663
5,personalized training plans,"Subscription schemes to bleed customers dry ad infinitum are the only option offered to obtain the software's full functionality; there is no possibility to purchase the program once and for all.
