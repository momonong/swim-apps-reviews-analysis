0,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!",0.48147053
1,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",0.48147053
2,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don’t know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!",0.48147053
3,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. 

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. 

Thanks for a game changing product!",0.88169223
4,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","I love the product and app. Everything is done very well and I can’t imagine my life without the googles. Some reviews claim that this product should be for serious swimmers.

It is for everyone!",0.8820722
5,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","I love these goggles so much, but when it comes to charging them the goggles won’t charge well. I’ll put them on the charger and the red light comes on. I’ve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light. I understand that the goggles are new and still working through updates and I really appreciate what this company has done for swimming!",0.48147053
6,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder",I don’t understand their pricing but right now I don’t care because I like this app and my goggles so much.

7,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","After admiring them for awhile, I’m very grateful to have been gifted a pair of Form goggles by my teammate.

I really look forward to learning more about my swims afterwards as well as seeing the real time info available as I swim!!!",0.8844234
8,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder",I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace,0.48147053
9,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder",If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form. Would be cool to see an estimated distance so I don’t have to do the math myself.,0.48147053

39,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣",0.48147053

41,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","This is a great product and app. As someone who still wants to swim daily but doesn't have time for a team, this is the next best thing to having a coach standing next to you in the pool (just without all the yelling). I'm amazed with the goggles motion awareness and accuracy (my watches will often +/- a leangth randomly). My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!",0.8764623
42,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","Update: The so continues to improve. The import from TP is excellent.

47,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","I love the goggles and the app! Spectacular!

Despite some early issues the goggles performed flawlessly afterwards. They are a major motivator to swim regularly and stimulate me to better my times.

51,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder","In general, it works well. Keeps track of workout and is easy to read. My one gripe is the way the workout builder is set up. You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",0.48147053

166,lenth-by-length instructions,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!",0.32540908
167,lenth-by-length instructions,"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",0.32540908
168,lenth-by-length instructions,"This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don’t know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!",0.32540908
169,lenth-by-length instructions,"This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. 

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. 

Thanks for a game changing product!",0.9490868

It is for everyone!",0.9493404
171,lenth-by-length instructions,"I love these goggles so much, but when it comes to charging them the goggles won’t charge well. I’ll put them on the charger and the red light comes on. I’ve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light. I understand that the goggles are new and still working through updates and I really appreciate what this company has done for swimming!",0.32540908
172,lenth-by-length instructions,I don’t understand their pricing but right now I don’t care because I like this app and my goggles so much.

I really look forward to learning more about my swims afterwards as well as seeing the real time info available as I swim!!!",0.9509042
174,lenth-by-length instructions,I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace,0.32540908
175,lenth-by-length instructions,If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form. Would be cool to see an estimated distance so I don’t have to do the math myself.,0.32540908

205,lenth-by-length instructions,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣",0.32540908

207,lenth-by-length instructions,"This is a great product and app. As someone who still wants to swim daily but doesn't have time for a team, this is the next best thing to having a coach standing next to you in the pool (just without all the yelling). I'm amazed with the goggles motion awareness and accuracy (my watches will often +/- a leangth randomly). My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!",0.94557333
208,lenth-by-length instructions,"Update: The so continues to improve. The import from TP is excellent.

Who else has access to my data and where did I consent to that?) Could we also expect some further integrations in the future? (e.g. Google Fit?)",0.94557333
214,lenth-by-length instructions,Really great app and goggles.

You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",0.32540908

332,analyze your metrics,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too.

333,analyze your metrics,"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",0.9865921
334,analyze your metrics,"This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles.

Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve.

341,analyze your metrics,If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate.

371,analyze your metrics,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣",0.9865921

I'm amazed with the goggles motion awareness and accuracy (my watches will often +/- a leangth randomly). My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!",0.16320553

You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",0.9865921

However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too.

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",0.9810441

507,connect with the community,If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate.

537,connect with the community,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣",0.9810441

My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!",0.1937844

You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",0.9810441

664,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!",0.45871416
665,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",0.45871416
666,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don’t know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!",0.45871416
667,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. 

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. 

Thanks for a game changing product!",0.89356345

669,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"I love these goggles so much, but when it comes to charging them the goggles won’t charge well. I’ll put them on the charger and the red light comes on. I’ve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light.

672,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace,0.45871416
673,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form.

703,customize your goggles(split times/stroke count/pace per 100),"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣",0.45871416
