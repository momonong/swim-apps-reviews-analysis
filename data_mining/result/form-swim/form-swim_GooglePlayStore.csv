0,5,"This is a great product and app. As someone who still wants to swim daily but doesn't have time for a team, this is the next best thing to having a coach standing next to you in the pool (just without all the yelling). I'm amazed with the goggles motion awareness and accuracy (my watches will often +/- a leangth randomly). My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!"
1,3,"The app is fine. Billing is weird. Form tried to bill me using Google Pay, which is fine. BUT the name was a person not ""FORM,"" so I suspected fraud and stopped the transaction thru my credit card. Once I verified that it was FORM, i have been in anightmare secnario with goole pay and Form. There is no way to renew the subscription once it expires. No tabs or buttons or icons in Google pay or the form app to re-subscribe so I can get workouts. Looking forward to hearing a solution so I don't have to switch to another product."
2,5,"Update: The so continues to improve. The import from TP is excellent. Upgrading to 5* Suggestion: Link up with Magic 5 and get them to produce compatible eye cups/seals. Would be awesome. So far so good. Used the goggles and app for a week. It's been very good. Will come back and give an update after I have used it longer. Could be improved if workouts were CSS based, but I guess I'll get over that small issue."
3,2,"The most recent update doesn't allow me to view lap times within intervals. I can only view the total time for the interval or lap time for every single lap, not traced to intervals."
4,5,"The app just works, syncing the swim from my goggles and uploading to Strava seamlessly. I couldn't ask for more. Update: They removed the ""premium membership expired"" messages from the goggle firmware in their latest update, so I'm reinstating a 5-star review for listening to user feedback."
5,5,Love these goggles and app! Have been using them for 2 years and it has made a huge difference in my training as well as motivation.
6,5,"Everything is working fine. The goggles are really good and the App is also very straightforward and easy to use. One feature that would be great to see is to have the option to sync your own structured workouts from other platforms like TrainingPeaks, and do them on the goggles! I'm sure that would be a feature many swimmers and Triathletes would love to see since many Athletes follow a personalised Plan. Thank you for the great Product. I'm Looking forward to seeing more features."
7,3,"I've had to knock some points off unfortunately. In general, the app is good and the Strava integration is great, but I have to reboot my phone (Pixel 3, Android 11) every single time to sync, which is a pain. Also, it constantly misregisters my strokes as 'mixed' rather than crawl – also a pain. There's still no way to see the current clock time in any of the dashboards (actual time, not minutes swam), which would be really useful for swimmers fitting in a session before work or in a lunch break."
8,5,Simple for looking to swim and monitor efficiency. Haven't tried workouts from them yet.
9,4,"I love the goggles and the app! Spectacular! But why does the app need an internet connection to refresh the results? It should be done locally via Bluetooth. (In the same context, I didn't appreciate receiving a marketing email saying ""now that you've used the goggles a couple of times""... How do you know that? Who else has access to my data and where did I consent to that?) Could we also expect some further integrations in the future? (e.g. Google Fit?)"
10,5,Really great app and goggles. I wish it could time out the display until I get close to a turn so I don't have to always see the numbers when zen and speeding through the water! UPDATED: Thank you for the reply. Leaving the question because it shows how easy this was to do once I found this customization area and how awesome this makes the device! Thank you for making a great product!!!
11,2,"The FORM app and goggles itself are of superb quality and I'm a very happy triathlete because of it. They have been fundamental to my training Why two stars then? While, that's all because I feel FORM is changing the rules of the game while we are playing. They have introduced guided workouts (great!) but decided to put it behind a subscription. I disagree with this decision but even worse - the price is completely ridiculous. 19 EUR by month? Really? I seriously thought this was a mistake.."
12,4,Nice clean ans simple app interface. So far I had 4 sessions and I love it. It is very helpful to see running clock vs specific metrics in goggles. Would be nice to have ability to change metrics in the pool. So far I learned how to set metrics on the phone and synch before a pool session.
13,5,"I originally purchased a pair 12/2019. Despite some early issues the goggles performed flawlessly afterwards. They are a major motivator to swim regularly and stimulate me to better my times. While competitive swimmers are probably all familiar with Form's goggles, I highly recommend them for casual swimmers like me who, at 60, is staying healthy by taking swimming up again after 45 years. Fantastic service, great product."
14,3,"Generally good and clear but I frequently have to restart my android phone to synch, and now I'm not able to watch the video tutorials anymore which is a big problem (no idea why, it just says ""we can't open this file type""). If everything worked as expected would be a 5 stars"
15,4,"In general, it works well. Keeps track of workout and is easy to read. My one gripe is the way the workout builder is set up. You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m."
16,5,"Amazing goggles and app, definitely helped me improve my swim times by a lot. Also, since they are kinda pricey (well worth) they are expensive enough to be an extra incentive to swim, cause besides swimming these goggles wont be used anywhere else! Def try em out if you like to swim and want to improve your timing!"
17,5,"Game changer!!! This is amazing! As a lifelong competitive swimmer I wish I had found this 20 years ago. It gives your pace per lap, you have a pace clock in your vision. It is easy to operate, easy to see and the actual goggle itself is watertight and comfortable. I absolutely love it!"
18,1,"Australian customer. When first opening the app and trying to create an account I can't get past the create bio page. Same error regardless of method of registration (Facebook, Gmail, email) ""something went wrong"". Goggles are useless without the app as can't update software. Expensive and disappointing. Don't bother if you don't live in the US."
19,5,"I rated a 5. However, the ""swim screen"" should really have a stopwatch counter that resets each turn (even for 25m). Without the polar heart rate monitor, there is little I find useful to display on that ""swim screen"" that couldn't already be displayed on the ""turn screen"""
20,1,Not very good. The unit buttons were defective and so I couldn't save my first swim with it. Returned it and waiting for a refund. Quality control is essential for a device like this. Lacking here. Really disappointed.
21,5,Loving these goggles. I use them for both open water and training with my club. If using for open water I suggest pairing with a garmin watch to get more tracking details but the pool information logged and tracked is amazing. It pushes me harder and keeps my stroke count and pace consistent when I need it.
22,5,"Form are the best tech for swimming. This is the most complete app for swimming I believe.. love it. Very easy to use, very clean design and a lot of metrics.. almost every thing you.can immagine is there..."
23,5,Far more accurate than I would have thought Great for knowing what I need to hold to make interval with rest
24,5,I love being able to concentrate on my swim stroke rather than keeping count of my laps. I have found it to be very accurate and like being able to sync it to my phone and review all my swims.
25,5,"Been using this app with the goggles for several months now and it's amazing! I have trouble keeping count of my laps, so having a device that helps keep track as well as give me my pace, makes all the difference."
26,1,"$200 lap counter. After 5 sessions in a 25m pool, I realize these googles are almost worthless. First and foremost: they do NOT ACCURATELY COUNT FREESTYLE STROKES. I mean way way off. I typically hit 16-17 strokes per length, these things will count towards of 40. So much for your SWOLF score. Also, you cannot add more than 150m of drills if you have a 25m pool selected. After getting in touch with support, they admit both these issues are known and 'keep an eye out for an update'. Return"
27,5,"Works great with the swim goggles! The redesign is excellent. Make sure you enable gps/location services before pairing though, because the app doesn't prompt you."
28,5,Ive had this for a week so far. Ive had zero issues. Im really enjoying my goggles and all the data they collect. The app is easy to navigate and there is a lot of info to look through.
29,1,"Goggles themselves rock. App sucks. Need a way to edit swim length for laps the goggles don't pick up. Also, need a way to choose content to view in app: I care nothing about""following"" others, yet that's the default."
30,5,The Form App is exceptional! Easy to use and incredible partner for these great goggles
31,5,Easy to learn and use. Useful information. Not overly complicated.
32,4,overall very user- friendly. however witnessed one glitch in my few days of using.
33,5,I was not sure what to expect but Form is fantastic! The data is very clear and easy to interpret. When I realised that it synchronized with Strava and Garmin Connect I was 100% sold
34,5,Easy to get set up and way more data available than I realized there would be. Love swimming with these googles and the app makes it super easy to sync and read results.
35,4,"Out of the box, 2 hours later and still can't get past the Bio page. However, the company DID respond to my cry for help and worked on their end to fix the problem. I did not have to troubleshoot with them or get on a call. Thanks for helping me so quickly."
36,5,"Great app & product, only thing i'd add is a real time lap timer. Right now theres only an overall timer, and timer for the lap you just completed, but seeing it in real time would be very beneficial."
37,3,"Does this not yet have an auto shutdown feature while in swimming mode. However, customer service was very friendly and responsive and promised to fix this. Will change review to 5 stars once fixed."
38,4,Great app. Super happy. How to make it better : Need to drill down within an interval to view each lap. Need to correct the app if style mislabeled. Need to tell the app if I'm using hand or foot palms
39,4,It's a great app. Very intuitive and stable. I only wish I can zoom in into the timeline and see particular time periods more granular
40,1,"Not much is working in this new update. Edit: All seems to work as long as I agree to let the App access my location. Please fix, I don't want to provide my location. Thanks"
41,5,"I dont know what I was doing this long without my FORM goggles. They're great. Splits,stoke count type total.meters swam. Wow all swimmers from beginnrs to world class should have a pair. Thanks for the great product. Norther Alberta Canada."
42,1,I cannot turn the goggles on to pair it. There is no screen. Tried to hard reset did not work battery is full. Tried to upgrade the goggles .after 5 hours still not done. Bluetooth and internet on. HELP ME PLEASE !!!!!!!!
43,5,I was so excited to finally get my pair! Having the ability to check my pace distance during my swim is absolutely amazing! (Especially during an open water swim) I am very much looking forward to see what else FORM has planned 🤗
44,5,It's great to just concentrate on technique and listen to my music and not count laps. Hopefully can save some money and get heart rate monitor.
45,2,"Constantly over calculates swim distance. Did 1200 meters and form said I did 1,975 meters. Wish there is a way to configure pool length by pushing a button."
46,5,Work like a charm and sync with the goggle seamlessly. Swim results presented in a well organized form. Love it!
47,5,Amazing! One of the best ways to know how much your doing and the calorie you have lost and with the split times after every length.
48,5,Initially I had trouble getting the app to sync with Strava but the developer was quite responsive and fixed it relatively quickly.
49,1,"Unable to update the newly bought Goggles, kept trying over and over with different troubleshooting and nothing worked. Probably got a defective set"
50,5,Great app to go along with my Form goggles. Bluetooth setup was so easy and everything is working flawlessly. Kudos to the team!
51,5,"Great app, easy to use with great custom options. I am really enjoying the goggles I think they are going to be a great tool in improving my performance."
52,5,"Incredible. It helped me design a swimfit program for myself that reversed my pre-diabetic state, and lost 20kg (sorry only metric 🤣) as a result. My swims are now relaxing and pure joy knowing exactly how many calories im burning. Ps, and Form, THANKS FOR THE SWIM CAPS 🇨🇦💗"
53,5,The greatest advantage is seeing the swimming stats and heart rates during swimmining. Pace and heart-rate measurements are more accurate than most other devices.
54,5,"Excellent app that accurately keeps track of my distance, strokes, and intensity."
55,5,The goggles are amazing. The app is pretty see less in terms of integration with the goggles. No complaints here.
56,1,Unable to cancel subscription
57,5,Form goggles really move you to the next level. Clear precise instructions. They have thought of everything.
58,5,"I have over 260 swim miles on my goggles. They remind me when I ""lose focus"" during a longer swim and start slowing down. In an open water swim along a beach, I can swim a 'half mile' turn around and swim a 'half mile' back, walk out of the ocean and my towel is right there. I don't swim without my FORM goggles."
59,5,A very neat piece of technology for swimming. Looking forward to the open water update.
60,5,"Obviously this app is only useful if you have the goggles, which are great! If you don't have the goggles then it would be of zero value"
61,5,A great companion app
62,5,What an amazing piece of equipment designed to improve your swimming. Once you use it you'll never want to train with out it
63,5,Formswim goggles are the best way of monitoring my swim training. The live heart rate helps me pace. Custom workouts boost my motivation.
64,5,Great app. I like the format of a workout analysis screen. Even before got the goggles preferred analysis of Garmin swim data in this app compared to Garmin app.
65,2,This app has used up 1.44GB yes GB in 2 days? I streamed a whole soccer game and it didn't even come close to this apps usage. Why it uses this my data is beyond me!
66,3,"Android requires a Bluetooth passkey to pair, the app does not over ride this therefore the goggles cannot be paired."
67,5,It would be cool to be able to compare your performance on the same workout over time. Or just analyze your progress over time.
68,5,"Amazing stats, goals and shows areas to improve. 100 % recommended!"
69,5,This is a great app paired with the goggles. I definitely pushed myself harder w/ the pair.
70,5,"Great insight to the details, however the real win is the dynamic feedback whilst swimming, happy dayz!!"
71,5,Great analysis of my swims and the goggles are just brilliant. I feel like a swimming borg lol.
72,5,Excellent information. Very easy to use. Logical setup.
73,5,"After only a few days of using the goggles and the app, I am loving the amount of data that I'm getting. Now I just need to speed up."
74,1,"I cant create a profile there, i dont understand validation message. Weak efforts from UX and development team"
75,1,"Tried to download the app multiple times, but it won't connect, just says pending."
76,5,I enjoy swimming more because I can focus on listening to books to pass the time instead of trying to remember my lap number
77,5,A great training tool. Finally feedback during the swim.
78,5,"I am impressed how well it keeps the laps count in the pool. I'm still new to it, I'll update this review later on."
79,5,Works perfectly and has all the apropiate data with pretty cool visualizations.
80,3,"Cannot download. Took 2+ hours and 6 attempts but now its downloaded thank you. Does the $35 ex delivery charge cover the inport duty into Colombia also, please?"
81,5,"Essential for data nerds!! Easy to use and the workouts make my ""swimming"" make sense"
82,5,Accurate on lengths and time. Interesting to see the breakdowns as well
83,5,Amazing experience between the goggle and the app. Very highly recommended!
84,1,"I get many ptoblem when try to connect with device , iget message "" you can not optimized on your device"""
85,4,Great app sync does take a couple of tries before it takes though.
86,5,"Fantastic training aid ... coach, mentor, educator, judge, jury & hangman!! Fantastic tool to have in the toolbox."
87,5,"I gave 5 star just to keep the team motivated for the start, and I am just testing the app without the googles yet. I wanna switch from my Polar watch to this google, but where is the HeartRate zone/graph section...? I wanna buy this with HR only."
88,5,Great. Like to monitor rest time between repetitions.
89,5,It's a great swim tool and great for doing solo workouts.
90,5,"Love love love. I refuse to swim without my Form Swim Goggles. Workouts and stats, oh my!"
91,5,Great...had an issue connecting Garmin opened a ticket got it fixed in no time!
92,5,It would be great to personalize the length of the pool in the next update because my condo pool is less than 25 metres.
93,5,"Clear vision, easy to follow cues, great training plans"
94,5,Great Sports Tech. Waiting for the Open Water capability.
95,5,"Excellent goggles, what a great device. I would highly recommend."
96,5,unable to update the new googles first but it works after many trials and it is very good
97,5,"What a great product, changed my swimming completely!"
98,4,"Works really well with the form goggles, which are great"
99,5,"Amazing Google !! Definitely a must have for swimming lovers for training, weightloss you name it !"
100,4,It helps identify my weaknesses and strengths in order to make intelligent decisions about my training
101,3,"Would be 5 star, only.problrm that's a pain for me is that pool swims don't sync to Garmin account so you don't keep all your workouts in one place"
102,5,Great app with lots of workouts to choose from
103,5,Amazing swim now that I have these goggles. I just recieved about a week ago been in pool everyday. Looking forward to tomorrow swim.
104,5,Great app as stand alone or in addition to Garmin Connect
105,5,This is best device ever...information is power...all right here...I am very pleased
106,3,I want to look into buying but see that you don't support the Garmin Decent MK1 watch so can't download the data field. Are there plan to open this up to more watches?
107,5,Excellent representation of swim sets
108,5,Excellent and fabulous app support
109,4,I only wish for Galaxy watch support.
110,5,Nice statistics and information
