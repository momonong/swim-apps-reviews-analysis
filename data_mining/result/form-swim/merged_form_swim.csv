0,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!",5,Amazing!

1,"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",5,Very motivating,0.2081818181818182,0.5400000000000001,positive,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder",0.9816537

3,"The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible.

There’s no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don’t take the proper steps of progression then I don’t get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",3,"It’s fine, but not revolutionary",0.1651515151515151,0.3746212121212121,positive,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder",0.19067258

59,"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM’s only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ….FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",2,Does not sync to Apple Health,0.1009135472370766,0.4929144385026736,positive,"choose own plans or workouts in app,can also load own workouts through custom workout builder",0.9816537

60,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far.
