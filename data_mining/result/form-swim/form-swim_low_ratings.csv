3,"The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don‚Äôt have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There‚Äôs no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don‚Äôt take the proper steps of progression then I don‚Äôt get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",3,"It‚Äôs fine, but not revolutionary"
7,"I like the FORM goggles and what they provide, but I just cannot understand why I need to pay an extra $19 a month to import workouts I write myself into a product I already own. 

If I wanted to access the library, or share workouts with my friends (spoiler - I have none. I‚Äôm a triathlete‚Ä¶ lol) that would be one thing. But it seems exploitative to force me to pay a recurring fee to use even the most basic feature.

I just want to see my own workouts in front of me. Why do I have to send money to other people for that privilege?!",2,Good Goggles - Do Not Like Plan Structure
10,"I was really disappointed to learn the collected data from the Form Goggles cannot be pushed to Garmin Connect. Form should take a look at how Zwift (for cycling) does it because it cannot be that hard!

UPDATE:
Response from Form: ‚ÄúUnfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.‚Äù

My Response:
First, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I‚Äôm sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin‚Äôs limitation? 

BTW, I‚Äôve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.",3,Doesn‚Äôt Push Data to Garmin Connect
12,"Goggles/software do function well and as advertised. However, subscription price for workouts in addition to the high initial cost of buying their product is a slap in the face. Almost every other sport tracking wearable gives you the ability to integrate workouts with no extra cost. I will stick to manually performing workouts with the unsubscribed version until they break, then likely seek a different brand.",3,Subscription??
15,"I have these googles and they are pretty neat.  I‚Äôm fortunate to be grandfathered in and the workouts features are nice.  I‚Äôm very disappointed that Form decided to move to a subscription model for any future users.  You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

See below the email I received from FORM.

If you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26. Real-time metrics in pool, open water, and swim spa are now part of the FORM membership. New swimmers will be required to have an active membership to access this and all member features.",1,Buyer Beware - Subscription Required to Use Goggles
17,"I have been using the goggles regularly for both pool and OW swims. Both with Apple Watch and Garmin connect as the goggles when used for OW simply function as a display while the Watch control the recording and swim.

1. Current pace not available, only average page for entire workout
2. HR displayed after pausing workout is wrong, both in FORM app and goggles. Heart rate shown is 20 BPM above actual rate and when examine using the FORM app the entire second half of the swim has HR increased by 20 BPM compared to first half.

In short totally unreliable data.

Furthermore this kind of errors are obvious software bugs and reveals that the goggles have not been tested properly when used for OW swims.

The only thing the goggles can be used for during OW swim is to display the total distance.",1,Unfinished product with serious shortcomings
18,"Compared to regular swim googles these googles reduce your vision by about 50 percent. That‚Äôs a big trade off to have have data that is available, slightly delayed, from other sources like Apple Watch and and pool time clocks.  Open water swimming requires navigation and spotting landmarks.  This is extremely difficult with the tunnel vision and smoked tint of these google.  Feels like you are swimming in a cave.  Fit is average as the googles can be worn with either side up which is sub-optimal for a good fit.",1,Wait for later generations
19,"The googles are great! The app is also clean and easy to use. However, as a competitive swimmer many of the workouts are very simple. I would like the ability to create my own workouts so then I have complete control on the workouts and then could align with my workout schedule.",3,Needs the Ability to Create Custom Workouts
22,"I use a Garmin watch and Garmin connect to track my swims. Form will retrieve my data from the watch but if I just use the goggle data it won‚Äôt interface with Garmin connect. Also I accidentally deleted a swim and there is no way to re-retrieve the data or copy yesterday‚Äôs swim. It‚Äôs a new app so I get it. The goggles are awesome, clear and informative.",3,Can only get better
28,There is no app support. Multiple attempts at contact have gone unanswered for weeks. No ability to create your own workout and download to goggles. Have to join a subscription service for workouts. There are some included with the app but seem ti be geared to the novice swimmer.,1,No support
42,How many times do I have to say 'no thanks to join your free trial? It's however many times a week I Swim! Stop harassing me,2,Goggles amazing..app annoying
44,The software is decent. The actual goggles have poor field of vision for sighting in open water,2,Decent pool. OWS needs work
45,for some reason the app doesnt work for me.,3,"Good build, but couldnt get past the ‚Äòcreate a bio‚Äô page on the app."
46,The fit is superb. The lap count and total distance cover are inaccurate. I noticed that the unit misses flip turns occasionally.,3,Good goggles.
48,App is not intuitive and difficult to navigate on phone. Googles are horribly inconsistent in tracking laps.  Very disappointed.,1,Not intuitive
49,The goggles are the best thing in the pool I just wish it would connect to the apple health app,3,Wish it synced with health kit
50,My one complaint is the main stats can‚Äôt include Average Pace / 100 yards!,3,Need Average pace / 100 yard
56,New software update broke the goggles,1,Goggles are stuck in ‚Äúupdating goggles‚Äù
57,As described in title,1,Unable to select goggle name in pairing setup. So far no luck with the app.
58,It recognizes freestyle but all my breast strokes are considered resting üò¢ - I‚Äôm in a swim spa.,1,Bad at stroke detection
59,"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM‚Äôs only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ‚Ä¶.FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",2,Does not sync to Apple Health
