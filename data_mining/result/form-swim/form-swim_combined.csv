0,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!",5
1,"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",5
2,"This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don’t know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!",5
3,"The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don’t have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There’s no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don’t take the proper steps of progression then I don’t get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",3
4,"This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. 

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. 

Thanks for a game changing product!",5
5,"I love the product and app. Everything is done very well and I can’t imagine my life without the googles. Some reviews claim that this product should be for serious swimmers. I am a terrible form, overweight guy trying to lose 100 pounds and this app and googles have already made a big difference and I’m swimming longer. So thankful for this product. It is for everyone!",5
6,"I love these goggles so much, but when it comes to charging them the goggles won’t charge well. I’ll put them on the charger and the red light comes on. I’ve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light. I understand that the goggles are new and still working through updates and I really appreciate what this company has done for swimming!",4
7,"I like the FORM goggles and what they provide, but I just cannot understand why I need to pay an extra $19 a month to import workouts I write myself into a product I already own. 

If I wanted to access the library, or share workouts with my friends (spoiler - I have none. I’m a triathlete… lol) that would be one thing. But it seems exploitative to force me to pay a recurring fee to use even the most basic feature.

I just want to see my own workouts in front of me. Why do I have to send money to other people for that privilege?!",2
8,I don’t understand their pricing but right now I don’t care because I like this app and my goggles so much. It was always so annoying to me to have to remember my labs. How to stop and click a clicker or write something down.  No more. I just swim. I just got the polar optical sensor I haven’t quite figured out how to connect it but when I do I may write more,5
9,"After admiring them for awhile, I’m very grateful to have been gifted a pair of Form goggles by my teammate. I’m fascinated by all the metrics available upon synching and am very happy with the very user friendly interface!  I really look forward to learning more about my swims afterwards as well as seeing the real time info available as I swim!!!",5
10,"I was really disappointed to learn the collected data from the Form Goggles cannot be pushed to Garmin Connect. Form should take a look at how Zwift (for cycling) does it because it cannot be that hard!

UPDATE:
Response from Form: “Unfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.”

My Response:
First, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I’m sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin’s limitation? 

BTW, I’ve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.",3
11,I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace,4
12,"Goggles/software do function well and as advertised. However, subscription price for workouts in addition to the high initial cost of buying their product is a slap in the face. Almost every other sport tracking wearable gives you the ability to integrate workouts with no extra cost. I will stick to manually performing workouts with the unsubscribed version until they break, then likely seek a different brand.",3
13,If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form. Would be cool to see an estimated distance so I don’t have to do the math myself.,4
14,"I bought the goggles for the real-time telemetry.  The true potential was the workouts.  I stay engaged and improving without boredom.  I use a plentiful variety of structured workouts that use drills, equipment and just plain fun to pour on the power!  My times are improving too.",5
15,"I have these googles and they are pretty neat.  I’m fortunate to be grandfathered in and the workouts features are nice.  I’m very disappointed that Form decided to move to a subscription model for any future users.  You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

See below the email I received from FORM.

If you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26. Real-time metrics in pool, open water, and swim spa are now part of the FORM membership. New swimmers will be required to have an active membership to access this and all member features.",1
16,"Form is the best in swimming metrics. The display quality and comfort of the googles are uniquely awesome, as well as the app! The only missing feature to be able set a certain distance to reach for the ability to count down and show the remaining distance. This is a base for a long distance swimmer.",4
17,"I have been using the goggles regularly for both pool and OW swims. Both with Apple Watch and Garmin connect as the goggles when used for OW simply function as a display while the Watch control the recording and swim.

1. Current pace not available, only average page for entire workout
2. HR displayed after pausing workout is wrong, both in FORM app and goggles. Heart rate shown is 20 BPM above actual rate and when examine using the FORM app the entire second half of the swim has HR increased by 20 BPM compared to first half.

In short totally unreliable data.

Furthermore this kind of errors are obvious software bugs and reveals that the goggles have not been tested properly when used for OW swims.

The only thing the goggles can be used for during OW swim is to display the total distance.",1
18,"Compared to regular swim googles these googles reduce your vision by about 50 percent. That’s a big trade off to have have data that is available, slightly delayed, from other sources like Apple Watch and and pool time clocks.  Open water swimming requires navigation and spotting landmarks.  This is extremely difficult with the tunnel vision and smoked tint of these google.  Feels like you are swimming in a cave.  Fit is average as the googles can be worn with either side up which is sub-optimal for a good fit.",1
19,"The googles are great! The app is also clean and easy to use. However, as a competitive swimmer many of the workouts are very simple. I would like the ability to create my own workouts so then I have complete control on the workouts and then could align with my workout schedule.",3
20,These goggles are fantastic and the app is the perfect complement. It lets me dig into my swim data to track my performance improvement. The app is well laid out and intuitive and allows you to share workout data among friends.,5
21,"These puppies are amazing! The AR display helps me track my laps and splits and times and distance and calories. WHILE I swim! It’s amazing and I love them. Plus, their customer service is excellent. 10/10 thank you FORM! Legiiiiiit.",5
22,"I use a Garmin watch and Garmin connect to track my swims. Form will retrieve my data from the watch but if I just use the goggle data it won’t interface with Garmin connect. Also I accidentally deleted a swim and there is no way to re-retrieve the data or copy yesterday’s swim. It’s a new app so I get it. The goggles are awesome, clear and informative.",3
23,The app is good: responsive and user friendly.  It’s great to see all the stats in one place as well as all of my workouts. Video tutorials of the drills are also very helpful,5
24,"I was a bit skeptical about these goggles and did not believe the hype, then I tried them. Wow, what a remarkable change to my training and focus. I love them.",5
25,I am enjoying the glasses and app.  Joining is too expensive considering I had to buy the goggles and already pay for pool time. Will hold on that for now,5
26,"Please let me have more stats on real time like I can choose for turn and rest.

Thanks!",5
27,Cannot wait to monitor my heartbeat live. Thank you Form Team.,5
28,There is no app support. Multiple attempts at contact have gone unanswered for weeks. No ability to create your own workout and download to goggles. Have to join a subscription service for workouts. There are some included with the app but seem ti be geared to the novice swimmer.,1
29,Form goggles are awesome.  Takes your swimming to a whole other level! And their customer service is top notch.,5
30,"Love the new graphs in the app, and excited to try out some of the new dashboard options",5
31,"So cool to get a quick in depth review of a swim. Broken down by stoke, stroke count, and interval!!!
Not to mention the exact rest interval, without ever looking at the clock!!!!",5
32,Going to have to share this with our other alumni swimmers. Great product! App is cool too.,5
33,This app is an unexpectedly amazing bonus to using the FORM Swim Goggles.  It feels like Strava for swimmers.  Nice work to all the developers who put this together.  👌,5
34,Never could keep track of laps and stats. These goggles help me know where I am at and keeps me motivated.,5
35,Paired easily with my goggles.  Syncs fairly quickly.  The data is rich and useful.  Helps round a pretty damned strong training experience with the form goggles,4
36,These goggles are great motivation to get to the pool and get fit.  Great value. Great support.   Changed swimming for this 67 year old.,5
37,"In a pair with Sony Waterproof headphones the googles motivates me to do more swim laps. 
Headphones keeps me entertained, and the googles tells me where I am at.",5
38,Great tool for anyone who is interested in quantifying their performance and efficiency.  Goggles are comfortable to wear and easy to use,5
39,Need to be able to export data excel or a graphing widget to analyze long term trends,5
40,Heads up display while swimming revolutionizes and revitalized swim practice.,5
41,These are great goggles!  I use them for pool swims and endless pool.  The pulse accessory works well.  I wish they’d partner with endless pool.,4
42,How many times do I have to say 'no thanks to join your free trial? It's however many times a week I Swim! Stop harassing me,2
43,Make make your Coaches redundant.,5
44,The software is decent. The actual goggles have poor field of vision for sighting in open water,2
45,for some reason the app doesnt work for me.,3
46,The fit is superb. The lap count and total distance cover are inaccurate. I noticed that the unit misses flip turns occasionally.,3
47,"I love the Goggles, but then they forced me to write a review losing good will.",5
48,App is not intuitive and difficult to navigate on phone. Googles are horribly inconsistent in tracking laps.  Very disappointed.,1
49,The goggles are the best thing in the pool I just wish it would connect to the apple health app,3
50,My one complaint is the main stats can’t include Average Pace / 100 yards!,3
51,Every penny!,5
52,The best gift ever!!!!,5
53,Love my new goggles.,5
54,Love this technology!,5
55,Pog u,5
56,New software update broke the goggles,1
57,As described in title,1
58,It recognizes freestyle but all my breast strokes are considered resting 😢 - I’m in a swim spa.,1
59,"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM’s only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ….FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",2
60,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣",5
61,"Great app, great goggles!",5
62,"This is a great product and app. As someone who still wants to swim daily but doesn't have time for a team, this is the next best thing to having a coach standing next to you in the pool (just without all the yelling). I'm amazed with the goggles motion awareness and accuracy (my watches will often +/- a leangth randomly). My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!",5
63,"The app is fine. Billing is weird. Form tried to bill me using Google Pay, which is fine. BUT the name was a person not ""FORM,"" so I suspected fraud and stopped the transaction thru my credit card. Once I verified that it was FORM, i have been in anightmare secnario with goole pay and Form. There is no way to renew the subscription once it expires. No tabs or buttons or icons in Google pay or the form app to re-subscribe so I can get workouts. Looking forward to hearing a solution so I don't have to switch to another product.",3
64,"Update: The so continues to improve. The import from TP is excellent. Upgrading to 5* Suggestion: Link up with Magic 5 and get them to produce compatible eye cups/seals. Would be awesome. So far so good. Used the goggles and app for a week. It's been very good. Will come back and give an update after I have used it longer. Could be improved if workouts were CSS based, but I guess I'll get over that small issue.",5
65,"The most recent update doesn't allow me to view lap times within intervals. I can only view the total time for the interval or lap time for every single lap, not traced to intervals.",2
66,"The app just works, syncing the swim from my goggles and uploading to Strava seamlessly. I couldn't ask for more. Update: They removed the ""premium membership expired"" messages from the goggle firmware in their latest update, so I'm reinstating a 5-star review for listening to user feedback.",5
67,Love these goggles and app! Have been using them for 2 years and it has made a huge difference in my training as well as motivation.,5
68,"Everything is working fine. The goggles are really good and the App is also very straightforward and easy to use. One feature that would be great to see is to have the option to sync your own structured workouts from other platforms like TrainingPeaks, and do them on the goggles! I'm sure that would be a feature many swimmers and Triathletes would love to see since many Athletes follow a personalised Plan. Thank you for the great Product. I'm Looking forward to seeing more features.",5
69,"I've had to knock some points off unfortunately. In general, the app is good and the Strava integration is great, but I have to reboot my phone (Pixel 3, Android 11) every single time to sync, which is a pain. Also, it constantly misregisters my strokes as 'mixed' rather than crawl – also a pain. There's still no way to see the current clock time in any of the dashboards (actual time, not minutes swam), which would be really useful for swimmers fitting in a session before work or in a lunch break.",3
70,Simple for looking to swim and monitor efficiency. Haven't tried workouts from them yet.,5
71,"I love the goggles and the app! Spectacular! But why does the app need an internet connection to refresh the results? It should be done locally via Bluetooth. (In the same context, I didn't appreciate receiving a marketing email saying ""now that you've used the goggles a couple of times""... How do you know that? Who else has access to my data and where did I consent to that?) Could we also expect some further integrations in the future? (e.g. Google Fit?)",4
72,Really great app and goggles. I wish it could time out the display until I get close to a turn so I don't have to always see the numbers when zen and speeding through the water! UPDATED: Thank you for the reply. Leaving the question because it shows how easy this was to do once I found this customization area and how awesome this makes the device! Thank you for making a great product!!!,5
73,"The FORM app and goggles itself are of superb quality and I'm a very happy triathlete because of it. They have been fundamental to my training Why two stars then? While, that's all because I feel FORM is changing the rules of the game while we are playing. They have introduced guided workouts (great!) but decided to put it behind a subscription. I disagree with this decision but even worse - the price is completely ridiculous. 19 EUR by month? Really? I seriously thought this was a mistake..",2
74,Nice clean ans simple app interface. So far I had 4 sessions and I love it. It is very helpful to see running clock vs specific metrics in goggles. Would be nice to have ability to change metrics in the pool. So far I learned how to set metrics on the phone and synch before a pool session.,4
75,"I originally purchased a pair 12/2019. Despite some early issues the goggles performed flawlessly afterwards. They are a major motivator to swim regularly and stimulate me to better my times. While competitive swimmers are probably all familiar with Form's goggles, I highly recommend them for casual swimmers like me who, at 60, is staying healthy by taking swimming up again after 45 years. Fantastic service, great product.",5
76,"Generally good and clear but I frequently have to restart my android phone to synch, and now I'm not able to watch the video tutorials anymore which is a big problem (no idea why, it just says ""we can't open this file type""). If everything worked as expected would be a 5 stars",3
77,"In general, it works well. Keeps track of workout and is easy to read. My one gripe is the way the workout builder is set up. You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",4
78,"Amazing goggles and app, definitely helped me improve my swim times by a lot. Also, since they are kinda pricey (well worth) they are expensive enough to be an extra incentive to swim, cause besides swimming these goggles wont be used anywhere else! Def try em out if you like to swim and want to improve your timing!",5
79,"Game changer!!! This is amazing! As a lifelong competitive swimmer I wish I had found this 20 years ago. It gives your pace per lap, you have a pace clock in your vision. It is easy to operate, easy to see and the actual goggle itself is watertight and comfortable. I absolutely love it!",5
80,"Australian customer. When first opening the app and trying to create an account I can't get past the create bio page. Same error regardless of method of registration (Facebook, Gmail, email) ""something went wrong"". Goggles are useless without the app as can't update software. Expensive and disappointing. Don't bother if you don't live in the US.",1
81,"I rated a 5. However, the ""swim screen"" should really have a stopwatch counter that resets each turn (even for 25m). Without the polar heart rate monitor, there is little I find useful to display on that ""swim screen"" that couldn't already be displayed on the ""turn screen""",5
82,Not very good. The unit buttons were defective and so I couldn't save my first swim with it. Returned it and waiting for a refund. Quality control is essential for a device like this. Lacking here. Really disappointed.,1
83,Loving these goggles. I use them for both open water and training with my club. If using for open water I suggest pairing with a garmin watch to get more tracking details but the pool information logged and tracked is amazing. It pushes me harder and keeps my stroke count and pace consistent when I need it.,5
84,"Form are the best tech for swimming. This is the most complete app for swimming I believe.. love it. Very easy to use, very clean design and a lot of metrics.. almost every thing you.can immagine is there...",5
85,Far more accurate than I would have thought Great for knowing what I need to hold to make interval with rest,5
86,I love being able to concentrate on my swim stroke rather than keeping count of my laps. I have found it to be very accurate and like being able to sync it to my phone and review all my swims.,5
87,"Been using this app with the goggles for several months now and it's amazing! I have trouble keeping count of my laps, so having a device that helps keep track as well as give me my pace, makes all the difference.",5
88,"$200 lap counter. After 5 sessions in a 25m pool, I realize these googles are almost worthless. First and foremost: they do NOT ACCURATELY COUNT FREESTYLE STROKES. I mean way way off. I typically hit 16-17 strokes per length, these things will count towards of 40. So much for your SWOLF score. Also, you cannot add more than 150m of drills if you have a 25m pool selected. After getting in touch with support, they admit both these issues are known and 'keep an eye out for an update'. Return",1
89,"Works great with the swim goggles! The redesign is excellent. Make sure you enable gps/location services before pairing though, because the app doesn't prompt you.",5
90,Ive had this for a week so far. Ive had zero issues. Im really enjoying my goggles and all the data they collect. The app is easy to navigate and there is a lot of info to look through.,5
91,"Goggles themselves rock. App sucks. Need a way to edit swim length for laps the goggles don't pick up. Also, need a way to choose content to view in app: I care nothing about""following"" others, yet that's the default.",1
92,The Form App is exceptional! Easy to use and incredible partner for these great goggles,5
93,Easy to learn and use. Useful information. Not overly complicated.,5
94,overall very user- friendly. however witnessed one glitch in my few days of using.,4
95,I was not sure what to expect but Form is fantastic! The data is very clear and easy to interpret. When I realised that it synchronized with Strava and Garmin Connect I was 100% sold,5
96,Easy to get set up and way more data available than I realized there would be. Love swimming with these googles and the app makes it super easy to sync and read results.,5
97,"Out of the box, 2 hours later and still can't get past the Bio page. However, the company DID respond to my cry for help and worked on their end to fix the problem. I did not have to troubleshoot with them or get on a call. Thanks for helping me so quickly.",4
98,"Great app & product, only thing i'd add is a real time lap timer. Right now theres only an overall timer, and timer for the lap you just completed, but seeing it in real time would be very beneficial.",5
99,"Does this not yet have an auto shutdown feature while in swimming mode. However, customer service was very friendly and responsive and promised to fix this. Will change review to 5 stars once fixed.",3
100,Great app. Super happy. How to make it better : Need to drill down within an interval to view each lap. Need to correct the app if style mislabeled. Need to tell the app if I'm using hand or foot palms,4
101,It's a great app. Very intuitive and stable. I only wish I can zoom in into the timeline and see particular time periods more granular,4
102,"Not much is working in this new update. Edit: All seems to work as long as I agree to let the App access my location. Please fix, I don't want to provide my location. Thanks",1
103,"I dont know what I was doing this long without my FORM goggles. They're great. Splits,stoke count type total.meters swam. Wow all swimmers from beginnrs to world class should have a pair. Thanks for the great product. Norther Alberta Canada.",5
104,I cannot turn the goggles on to pair it. There is no screen. Tried to hard reset did not work battery is full. Tried to upgrade the goggles .after 5 hours still not done. Bluetooth and internet on. HELP ME PLEASE !!!!!!!!,1
105,I was so excited to finally get my pair! Having the ability to check my pace distance during my swim is absolutely amazing! (Especially during an open water swim) I am very much looking forward to see what else FORM has planned 🤗,5
106,It's great to just concentrate on technique and listen to my music and not count laps. Hopefully can save some money and get heart rate monitor.,5
107,"Constantly over calculates swim distance. Did 1200 meters and form said I did 1,975 meters. Wish there is a way to configure pool length by pushing a button.",2
108,Work like a charm and sync with the goggle seamlessly. Swim results presented in a well organized form. Love it!,5
109,Amazing! One of the best ways to know how much your doing and the calorie you have lost and with the split times after every length.,5
110,Initially I had trouble getting the app to sync with Strava but the developer was quite responsive and fixed it relatively quickly.,5
111,"Unable to update the newly bought Goggles, kept trying over and over with different troubleshooting and nothing worked. Probably got a defective set",1
112,Great app to go along with my Form goggles. Bluetooth setup was so easy and everything is working flawlessly. Kudos to the team!,5
113,"Great app, easy to use with great custom options. I am really enjoying the goggles I think they are going to be a great tool in improving my performance.",5
114,"Incredible. It helped me design a swimfit program for myself that reversed my pre-diabetic state, and lost 20kg (sorry only metric 🤣) as a result. My swims are now relaxing and pure joy knowing exactly how many calories im burning. Ps, and Form, THANKS FOR THE SWIM CAPS 🇨🇦💗",5
115,The greatest advantage is seeing the swimming stats and heart rates during swimmining. Pace and heart-rate measurements are more accurate than most other devices.,5
116,"Excellent app that accurately keeps track of my distance, strokes, and intensity.",5
117,The goggles are amazing. The app is pretty see less in terms of integration with the goggles. No complaints here.,5
118,Unable to cancel subscription,1
119,Form goggles really move you to the next level. Clear precise instructions. They have thought of everything.,5
120,"I have over 260 swim miles on my goggles. They remind me when I ""lose focus"" during a longer swim and start slowing down. In an open water swim along a beach, I can swim a 'half mile' turn around and swim a 'half mile' back, walk out of the ocean and my towel is right there. I don't swim without my FORM goggles.",5
121,A very neat piece of technology for swimming. Looking forward to the open water update.,5
122,"Obviously this app is only useful if you have the goggles, which are great! If you don't have the goggles then it would be of zero value",5
123,A great companion app,5
124,What an amazing piece of equipment designed to improve your swimming. Once you use it you'll never want to train with out it,5
125,Formswim goggles are the best way of monitoring my swim training. The live heart rate helps me pace. Custom workouts boost my motivation.,5
126,Great app. I like the format of a workout analysis screen. Even before got the goggles preferred analysis of Garmin swim data in this app compared to Garmin app.,5
127,This app has used up 1.44GB yes GB in 2 days? I streamed a whole soccer game and it didn't even come close to this apps usage. Why it uses this my data is beyond me!,2
128,"Android requires a Bluetooth passkey to pair, the app does not over ride this therefore the goggles cannot be paired.",3
129,It would be cool to be able to compare your performance on the same workout over time. Or just analyze your progress over time.,5
130,"Amazing stats, goals and shows areas to improve. 100 % recommended!",5
131,This is a great app paired with the goggles. I definitely pushed myself harder w/ the pair.,5
132,"Great insight to the details, however the real win is the dynamic feedback whilst swimming, happy dayz!!",5
133,Great analysis of my swims and the goggles are just brilliant. I feel like a swimming borg lol.,5
134,Excellent information. Very easy to use. Logical setup.,5
135,"After only a few days of using the goggles and the app, I am loving the amount of data that I'm getting. Now I just need to speed up.",5
136,"I cant create a profile there, i dont understand validation message. Weak efforts from UX and development team",1
137,"Tried to download the app multiple times, but it won't connect, just says pending.",1
138,I enjoy swimming more because I can focus on listening to books to pass the time instead of trying to remember my lap number,5
139,A great training tool. Finally feedback during the swim.,5
140,"I am impressed how well it keeps the laps count in the pool. I'm still new to it, I'll update this review later on.",5
141,Works perfectly and has all the apropiate data with pretty cool visualizations.,5
142,"Cannot download. Took 2+ hours and 6 attempts but now its downloaded thank you. Does the $35 ex delivery charge cover the inport duty into Colombia also, please?",3
143,"Essential for data nerds!! Easy to use and the workouts make my ""swimming"" make sense",5
144,Accurate on lengths and time. Interesting to see the breakdowns as well,5
145,Amazing experience between the goggle and the app. Very highly recommended!,5
146,"I get many ptoblem when try to connect with device , iget message "" you can not optimized on your device""",1
147,Great app sync does take a couple of tries before it takes though.,4
148,"Fantastic training aid ... coach, mentor, educator, judge, jury & hangman!! Fantastic tool to have in the toolbox.",5
149,"I gave 5 star just to keep the team motivated for the start, and I am just testing the app without the googles yet. I wanna switch from my Polar watch to this google, but where is the HeartRate zone/graph section...? I wanna buy this with HR only.",5
150,Great. Like to monitor rest time between repetitions.,5
151,It's a great swim tool and great for doing solo workouts.,5
152,"Love love love. I refuse to swim without my Form Swim Goggles. Workouts and stats, oh my!",5
153,Great...had an issue connecting Garmin opened a ticket got it fixed in no time!,5
154,It would be great to personalize the length of the pool in the next update because my condo pool is less than 25 metres.,5
155,"Clear vision, easy to follow cues, great training plans",5
156,Great Sports Tech. Waiting for the Open Water capability.,5
157,"Excellent goggles, what a great device. I would highly recommend.",5
158,unable to update the new googles first but it works after many trials and it is very good,5
159,"What a great product, changed my swimming completely!",5
160,"Works really well with the form goggles, which are great",4
161,"Amazing Google !! Definitely a must have for swimming lovers for training, weightloss you name it !",5
162,It helps identify my weaknesses and strengths in order to make intelligent decisions about my training,4
163,"Would be 5 star, only.problrm that's a pain for me is that pool swims don't sync to Garmin account so you don't keep all your workouts in one place",3
164,Great app with lots of workouts to choose from,5
165,Amazing swim now that I have these goggles. I just recieved about a week ago been in pool everyday. Looking forward to tomorrow swim.,5
166,Great app as stand alone or in addition to Garmin Connect,5
167,This is best device ever...information is power...all right here...I am very pleased,5
