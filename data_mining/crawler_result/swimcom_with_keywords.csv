0,"After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",4,Improved tracking but data analysis still weak,"['Pebble watch', 'hit or miss', 'Apple Watch', 'Pebble', 'watch', 'miss', 'tracking', 'app', 'years', 'hit']","['swimmer apps', 'swims competitive', 'breaststroke freestyle', 'freestyle frustrating', 'breaststroke', 'pace freestyle', 'distinguish breaststroke', 'apple watch', 'tracking pool', 'swimmer']"
1,"Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple’s UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the “X” should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).

Lastly, this has a very social media feel to it in some places, especially as I was going through the privacy settings, so if that isn’t your thing (like it isn’t for me), make sure you turn your profile to private.",3,"It has potential, but still needs work.","['App Design standpoint', 'Design Recommendations', 'Design standpoint', 'App Design', 'Design', 'Recommendations', 'Apple', 'n’t', 'App', 'Strictly']","['app functionality', 'app design', 'swims recorded', 'claims breaststroke', 'app', 'pool isn', 'strictly app', 'apple ui', 'engage app', 'breaststroke']"
2,"They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets. 

Still, I do like the improvements they’ve made in the last few years. Keep working on it.",4,"Good, but a little wonky with stroke detection","['stroke detection', 'Apple Watch', '’ve made', 'sets', 'years', 'stroke', 'good', 'app', '’ve', 'drill setting']","['apple watch', 'watch stroke', 'improvements app', 'workouts stroke', 'stroke detection', 'app years', 'edit workouts', 'experienced swimmer', 'improved recognizing', 'app']"
3,"At 70 yo I sometimes ( no, all the time) need motivation in these times to get up and do something healthy   Keeping track of my daily yardage and checking cumulative weekly, monthly and annual yards against others in similar age groups keeps me getting up early and driving daily to the Y.  Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.",5,Use it for motivation,"['checking cumulative weekly', 'similar age groups', 'healthy Keeping track', 'cumulative weekly', 'monthly and annual', 'daily yardage', 'driving daily', 'yardage and checking', 'checking cumulative', 'annual yards']","['track daily', 'hobby app', 'keeping track', 'app better', 'app', 'bout app', 'motivation times', 'wish app', 'app just', 'need motivation']"
4,"This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I’m part of a club team and we have “wall tap counters” (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you’re on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",2,Inaccurate/buggy,"['distance swam makes', 'makes it annoying', 'total distance swam', 'app', 'swam makes', 'consistent long distance', 'long distance swimmer', 'total distance', 'distance swam', 'long distance']","['app swimmers', 'swimmer 000meters', 'distance swam', 'distance swimmer', 'meters app', 'individual swimmers', 'number laps', 'laps swam', 'app accurate', 'swimmers swim']"
5,"Installed this app because I was looking for some better views on my watch of laps, time, heart rate, etc when swimming. The Apple Workout app wasn’t cutting it for me. The watch views are exactly what I was looking for but I noticed after a couple swims that my active calories are significantly under reported compared to the Apple app. When comparing heart rate data from other workouts it seems this app is under reporting rather than other apps over reporting. The difference is significant for a 30 minute workout, about half the reported calories.",4,Good Watch Views; Questionable Activity Tracking,"['Apple Workout app', 'Apple', 'app', 'time', 'heart rate', 'Apple Workout', 'Apple app', 'watch of laps', 'Installed', 'laps']","['workouts app', 'workout app', 'apple workout', 'reported calories', 'active calories', 'calories significantly', 'apps reporting', 'data workouts', 'app comparing', 'heart rate']"
6,"I want to like this app. It has potential, and I’ve stuck with it for the past three years. Unfortunately, the bugs are overwhelming. Even something as simple as drill mode, where the app doesn’t need to do anything except what it is told by the user, fails to record proper distance and time. Not to mention the latest “upgrade” to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn’t work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What’s more, half of the time the workouts don’t upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features. Make the app solid and reliable first, then focus on upgrades.",2,Bug fixes > Useless features,"['drill mode', 'app', 'Apple Watch', 'n’t', 'force touch', 'time', 'past three years', '’ve stuck', 'drill', 'mode']","['app potential', 'apple watch', 'time workouts', 'app solid', 'app', 'make app', 'bug fixes', 'workouts don', 'app doesn', 'fixes']"
7,I like this app because it’s the only one I know of that lets me edit back in my kick set yardage after the workout is done. There is no choice for a kick set in the editing section so I call them a drill. App worked well until recently then suddenly stopped uploading data to Apple health.

8,"Easy to use and manually add my yardage. I have a iWatch but can't figure out how to use it with this site
When I click the Leaderboard, it only shows I've done 75yds so I'm obviously doing something wrong as my 3x per week swims are close to 7,500.  I'm 67 yrs of age and since covid pandemic have been away from synchronized swimming so loving the pool again

9,"The new iPhone app format update is the worst user interface I've ever seen. Lots of wasted space with useless bar graphs and useless lifetime totals, difficult to see your last workout data, and hard to read it when you find it. And a new focus on offering workouts but if you don't need them you're going to have to constantly navigate around that. The Apple watch workout app shows the real data a million times better. Hopefully they'll fix it because their Apple watch app is better than the workout one. 

Lastly, still useful from an old review:
There are no weekly totals, no analysis of improvement. If they improve all this stuff it could be useful.",1,Needs work on interface in phone app,"['worst user interface', 'iPhone app format', 'app format update', 'format update', 'worst user', 'user interface', 'Apple watch', 'iPhone app', 'app format', 'Apple']","['workout app', 'workout data', 'watch app', 'watch workout', 'iphone app', 'app better', 'apple watch', 'better workout', 'app', 'new iphone']"
10,Communicated with John who was very helpful. App has always correctly recorded times for me for the almost two years that I’ve used it. But one swim recently showed correct total time but recorded each length as exactly same time - obvious error. John guided me through a few steps and consulted with his engineer. Problem seems to have fixed itself. I appreciated John’s concern and his checking in with me later to verify app was working fine now.,5,Weird record on one particular swim,"['John', 'Communicated', 'helpful', 'Communicated with John', 'recorded', 'time', 'App', 'obvious error', 'correctly recorded', 'obvious']","['time recorded', 'recorded times', 'recorded length', 'total time', 'correctly recorded', 'app correctly', 'swim recently', 'used swim', 'exactly time', 'swim']"
11,This app is great when it works. Just after the new iOS update the app has been buggy and lost two of my swims. I️ like that it handles rest between intervals and sets. I️ also like to set the drill mode. The Apple Watch workout app tracks in the background and it adds to your rings.  Ending a workout can be a pain since the way the Apple Watch and app are relying on pressure. Did a 4000 yard workout with my masters group and the app locked up and lost the workout. It needs serious fixes and an update. May go back to apples fitness app which is harder to handle I️.

12,"I haven’t even gotten around to using this app in the pool because the interface/settings are extremely cumbersome. This app won’t save your preferences on workout searches; it defaults back to the preferences you input when you set up your account. I made the “mistake” of setting up preferences that turned out to be very restrictive and only showed one workout.

13,Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line,4,Strava integration could be better,"['pace graph', 'reason integration', 'love improved', 'Swim', 'pace', 'strava', 'graph all messed', 'graph', 'updates', 'improved']","['swim app', 'edit swim', 'swim love', 'strava pace', 'actual swim', 'swim doing', 'better updates', 'swim', 'swim swim', 'post strava']"
14,"This app works. I am not sure where all the complaints come from. It counts laps, yards/meters, shows heart rate in one place. The new redesign on AW is just perfect. Especially the color coding.

16,"Only complaint is there’s no option to NOT put in distance. Sometimes I just swim for “time” and don’t count the distance. App requires a multiple to place in the distance box.

17,"My primary complaint is that the last lap appears to throw in a couple of seconds. One can check this by comparing the splits against the last. Now to work around this problem, I simply add another 50 yards to the interval and use the next to last split and final times. And it makes a better workout!

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

You are building a very good tool and our requests are a testimony that we’re using it but want more. Very common in the software business.

As I mentioned earlier I would be happy to pay for this app so don’t stop!

18,I’ve used this App for 4 years and over the last year it has been crashing and dropping my swims halfway through my 3500 yard sessions. I regularly have to check and manually add 1300+ yard sets to accurately track my total distance. I submitted a report and they told me it was because I’m not running the current version (which I am on an Apple Series 6).

19,I like the app on the Apple watch 2 but doesn’t translate well to iPhone. The workouts usually take days to sync and the calories always show 0 even though my watch obviously picks up the movement. It just doesn’t equate to the same number of calories as the resistance brings when the watch knows that your swimming. Not sure I explained well but it’s frustrating. The only thing I like about his app is that it differentiates resting vs swimming time. Haven’t found another swimming app that does that automatically.,2,Sync issues.

21,I like this app - it’s free and you can’t argue with the value for what it does (other apps charge you for stats/membership).

- my records section. I want to see my best times for different distances. It is cool to show a badge for fastest 400 yard but what is that time record? I think you can see this on the site but I could not find in app. 
- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths 
- more workouts to do. Options seem pretty limited to shorter distances. Master swim classes will do a 1650 for warm up.

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin.

208,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",3,Poor execution,"['swim app', 'swim', 'Garmin', 'Swim apps', 'yard', 'Swim apps wins', 'yard swim', 'stop', 'pool mate', 'pool']","['garmin swim', 'swim app', 'swim apps', 'intervals swim', 'measures swim', 'equal garmin', 'swim register', 'garmin wins', 'garmin', 'garmin change']"
209,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work.

I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.

225,"This app worked great for me for about a month. I love the drill function as I do a fair amount of kicking and one armed fly drills.

228,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",2,Great Concept.
