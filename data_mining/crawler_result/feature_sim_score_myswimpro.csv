0,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.9456331
1,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.8697449
2,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.9456331
3,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.46153757
4,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9456331
5,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9456331
6,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.9456331
7,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",0.9456331
8,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.9456331
9,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",0.9456331
10,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.9456331
11,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9456331
12,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.",0.9456331
13,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it. 

I can’t wait to see what goals I hit from now til winter! And I love that you can use GPS for free open water swim or put in how long your pool is. I also can’t wait to do this at the beach!",0.9456331
14,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  
Please respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.  Remember if it’s not broken why do u have to mess with it!",0.9456331
15,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am at 67 a new swimmer . I cannot begin to explain the benefit that this app and the outstanding customer support has bestowed to me. I started out needing to rest after 25 meters . Going to the pool to swim was a source of anxiety and I went because I knew it was in my best interest. Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training . You want to just swim go ahead and enjoy but if you want to improve and become engaged in a fun healthy sport ? Stop wasting your time sign up and join all of us at MySeimPro community . Go ahead , I dare you !",0.9456331
16,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.9456331
17,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.9456331
18,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.9456331
19,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",0.3252354
20,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.9913136
21,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.4287175
22,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.9456331
23,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.7668597
24,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.",0.9456331
25,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved. 

I recently had an issue with my account and the customer service was on point. I got an immediate response and my issue was resolved with that one response. Keep up the great work, MySwimPro!",0.9337764
26,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.3956899
27,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters",0.9723205
28,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This app is amazing and the customer service is awesome! I had been a swimmer growing up and always had access to a coach. But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming. I’ve lost more weight than I thought I could, I’m swimming faster now than when I was a kid and I feel like I’m apart of a community. This app really changed my life for the better.",0.9456331
29,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.9456331
30,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"While the app itself is amazing between the video demos, training options, workouts, and tracking available, the customer service is what has made me come and place this review. I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",0.9456331
31,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.9456331
32,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I really do like this app. I love that it gives analytics on distance per stroke. I wear an Apple
Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",0.9456331
33,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.4041062

I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market.

36,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",0.38955593

But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry.

I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava.

48,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.9456331

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.922264

61,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

The signup process was tedious, the amount of emails I have received already is overwhelming, and when I tried to watch some videos through the iOS and iPadOS app, the video would try to launch, but then it would close the video immediately after trying to watch.

After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.  I suggest you create an option where the user can only customize their workouts and log their workouts. All the other stuff on there I don’t even look at.,0.96830887
86,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. 

This behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. 

It’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.",0.9456331

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

305,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9456331

358,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9456331
359,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9456331
360,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

361,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book.

I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.7240623

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9456331

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

481,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.41337413
482,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.3422804
483,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9456331

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.8159775
488,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9456331

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts!

Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.9905555

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

508,Personalized swim Training Plans,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9905555
509,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9905555

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training .

520,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.9905555
521,Personalized swim Training Plans,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.",0.9905555

Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",0.9905555
523,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.2467815
526,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.9905555
527,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.6289632
528,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. 

Anyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.",0.21149455

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored.

535,Personalized swim Training Plans,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

540,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

560,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I had just started swimming again after not swimming for years and had recently became a lifeguard (again). I wanted to swim faster than my coworkers but just general fitness in general, so I took it upon myself for one of their annual sales for a year. Did it. I even had problems with the dry land part of the app syncing to my watch, CS (customer support) was more than happy to help with everything. All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",0.9905555
561,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.9905555
562,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.9905555
563,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I took me a really long time to just log a swim workout just now and every time I clicked “save” to add a set, pops up their ad to subscribe monthly or annually, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.8305986
564,Personalized swim Training Plans,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.99211645
565,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.9905555
566,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Up until this summer, I was able to create a simple workout and that was good for me - I know my times, I’m not looking to win medals or meets, but just wanted something that tracks workouts and tells me when to push off the wall. Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable. Even if they’d have offered an inexpensive option to just make your own workouts, I could be on board, but this isn’t worth the hassle.",0.99256366
567,Personalized swim Training Plans,"UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$. 

DON’T waste your time or money. Try other apps.",0.9905555
568,Personalized swim Training Plans,"After using for approx 3 months, 2-3 times a week I have to say, I am not happy. Around 40-45 minutes into any workout, randomly the watch app closes. And it’s not every time. Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank. Which means it didn’t record over to Strava or my health app on Apple. Overall I like it, which is why it got 3. But it is very frustrating to find the app closed after a workout is not quite done.",0.9905555
569,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.36776954
570,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

Again, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.",0.9905555

I paid for the full membership around 7 months ago, and I’m supposed to have quarterly 1:1 with a coach to help me, but aside from the first meet (which I didn’t know was video chat with the owner, my “coach” and some other guy), I’ve not received any kind of contact since. And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

572,Personalized swim Training Plans,My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.

As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee.

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

618,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I downloaded this app with high hopes. Unfortunately I encountered multiple issues right from the start, and eventually gave up and deleted it. 

After downloading the app to my phone and registering, I tried to open the app on my watch. It didn’t recognize that I had registered on my phone and wouldn’t move past the login screen. I had to restart my watch for it to log in. 

Once I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. 

Finally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout. 

3 restarts in the first 10 min of using the app. Don’t waste your time.",0.9905555
619,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I can’t advise this enough - RUN and do not do the trial. I didn’t remember signing up for a year subscription, just a 7 day trial that would result in a monthly fee after. I was automatically charged $100 after 7 days. I stopped using the app after the first swim, as it shuts off my Apple Watch ability to track data using Apple Health. I cannot find a customer support number anywhere, even though they promise their “premium” members ample support. More like endless links to wiki articles with no human in sight. Don’t make this mistake folks. This is a fraudulent app.",0.9905555
620,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track.

I have an Ionic, I loaded a workout last night, tried to use it this morning and it was fine, had to leave the pool to go get the phone to load it again. Then the app would not work because it the watch was not connected to the phone (had synchronized a minute before). Finally, I got the workout in, dis the workout and the data never made it to Fitbit dashboard. I also have an Apple Watch, I’m gonna test it with it, if it doesn’t work I’m deleting this app, so far not worth the money.",0.9905555
623,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The app looks great there are a lot of workout options and I liked the layout inside the workouts…when I could see it. Which brings me to why I’m giving it 3 stars, 99.9% of the app is behind a pay wall and it’s expensive. To pay for it on top of the gym membership to access the pool is not worth it. Especially since it doesn’t even sync with my smart watch (Fitbit).",0.51846516
624,Personalized swim Training Plans,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start.

Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.9919832
625,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",0.9927599

But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well.

Display while swimming is nicer than Apple Watch and it’s nice that some programs are included and displayed on screen but lap counts are less accurate than apples native app, the program is constantly wrong about which ones I have completed and the way it dynamically tries to update my times is way off.

641,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Although I grew up swimming in a pool, I have never swam for anything other than leisure. Due to a bad back I decided I wanted to try and learn techniques of swimming laps. This app gave me a workout but not what any of it means. What’s an FR, KI, IM, DR, etc? It’s not broken down into real basics. This appears more for someone who swam on team at some point. I don’t know technique and there are not videos for all the strokes.

643,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting. 

I love myswimpro!!!",0.9905555

701,Personalized swim Training Plans,It was alright until this update.  It has crashed 3 times in 2 days in the middle of my workouts.  It’s frustrating when you are 75% done with your workout and it stops and erases your progress.  I think I’ll just go back to doing it old school.  At least laminated paper doesn’t crash.,0.9923248
702,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I understand subscribing for personalized and updated content, but now My Swim Pro won’t even let you create your OWN workout without paying $30 per month.

703,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This app did not work well.  I have an iphone 7+ and tried using it this morning.  After my swim, i saved my workout on my watch only because my phone was not nearby.  Two hours later, i cant find the workout, nor can i upload it to the app on my phone.

708,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The entire app is a subscription you have to pay for. Dont you guys think you should have a hand full of workouts that are free so the user can determine if they like it or not?

709,Personalized swim Training Plans,I really like what this app has the possibility of doing but unfortunately it’s not there yet.

710,Personalized swim Training Plans,Loved the stats and the workouts available but has anyone else had an issue of the app not being able to close? When I was done swimming I went to hit finish and it wouldn’t let me. Ended up closing it out but it would keep reopening. Had to delete it eventually just so the app would stop.,0.9920397
711,Personalized swim Training Plans,All it does is provide an ad for the subscription services the offer. Click on anything within the app and you get an ad to upgrade to Pro.

715,Personalized swim Training Plans,So I have been using this terrible app for the past year. It is basically worthless. I used to pretend that the logged swims were accurate because I was so ready to support this app.  After a year of completely inaccurate results  with no improvement I’ve decided that this review was necessary.  I’m very critical because I am software rengineer and I wold be ashamed to release such a piece of garbage.,0.99204063
716,Personalized swim Training Plans,Unless you pay for the subscription which I can’t afford as it’s way to pricy you can’t do anything in the app. There are claims you get 5 workouts but every workout is locked it’s a huge scam. I don’t care how helpful it could be putting everything behind a paywall despite what is promised in the free use of the app is a scam.,0.9987532

Update: Based on Reading over reviews, it seems like this company is more interested in appearing helpful than actually making a product that functions properly.

809,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9905555

862,Personalized swim Training Plans,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9905555
863,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9905555
864,Personalized swim Training Plans,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.9695797
865,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.9905555
866,Personalized swim Training Plans,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.15080093
867,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.57774144
868,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9905555
869,Personalized swim Training Plans,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.9961714
870,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it's totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!",0.9905555
871,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.46673027
872,Personalized swim Training Plans,"But I do wish there was a place to put the desired workout time.

873,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.15015899
874,Personalized swim Training Plans,"When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything. I love using this app as it tracks my swimming but, the update has made it stressful and annoying.",0.99194014
875,Personalized swim Training Plans,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance. If you can eventually make it stay on the screen, there is no way to end and log your workout; the time keeps going and it says ""Ending workout..."" until you delete the app and reinstall it.",0.99247164
876,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming. I love that I can track my progress, pick from a variety of sets, and customize my workouts to my ability.  The videos are helpful, especially for those just getting into swimming.  The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.99213403

This does with some videos and other training sundries. Unfortunately 80% of the app is behind a subscribe monthly wall which is far outside my appetite.

Also some bugs in editing swims. No matter what I edit. It saves the default program unless it is custom from the ground up. 

Good stats screen and glad to see something enter the arena but the pricing model will eventually push me away.",0.30253214

Please fix the bugs and make the interface easier to use!",0.992185
879,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I just started back swimming laps and using my new Apple Watch. I like the features of my swim pro, it does show the different strokes. I usually swim 200 yd sets. 200 free, 200 back then 200 breast. How do I get the app to register the different strokes. If I swim without stopping at the end of a set, the app reports free. I have tried to pause between sets, then the app stops and doesn't register the next set. The app has even gone inactive and not recorded the session.",0.9905555

882,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I have high hopes for this app.  Would love to see the option to input my 100yd base interval.  The selection of beginner, intermediate, advanced seems too broad a bucket and I have no way of knowing if the workout intervals are designed for lots of rest or if I should manually drop the times.  Having heart rate data is great, but would like to see that used to help coach the appropriate workouts and intervals.  Thanks!",0.30068687
883,Personalized swim Training Plans,"If I could rate the app for the watch part probably a solid 3.5 stars 4 when you factory in the possibilities under future updates. But the phone part of the app is just off NO METRICS for anything really if you use a garmin swim watch 920xt or better or anything like that you will be disappointed to not find any of your stoke count, swolf report, or even pace per individual interval... glad I could unsubscribe immediately.",0.18594034

885,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Videos! Downloadable workouts! Stroke differentiation and auto-pause. Sure looks good and promises a lot. The problem is you can't actually start workouts from your Watch. Will hang indefinitely waiting for you to open one on your phone, which it won't recognize.

Developers are pretty responsive and open to feedback. 

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

I'd love to see the app get smarter about rest time. If I always finish a set well below the suggested time then it should adjust.",0.9905555

982,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.9905555

One of my problems is that I don’t have a 6 digit code come up on my watch, though I don’t know if the problems from the app or my watch. If I could get an answer that would be nose. Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",0.99203473
985,Personalized swim Training Plans,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.23035395
986,Personalized swim Training Plans,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.15500024
987,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9905555

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.68943083
992,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9905555
993,Personalized swim Training Plans,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.99654716

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.99654716
1013,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.99654716

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.16707788

I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market.

1044,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting.

1313,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.99654716

1366,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.99654716
1367,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.99654716
1368,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year",I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.9548298
1369,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.99654716

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

1371,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.53248835

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

1489,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year",VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.1770814
1490,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.1010338
1491,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.99654716

1496,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.99654716

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.53599405

It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.53599405

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

1516,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.53599405
1517,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.53599405
1518,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

1541,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.53599405
1542,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"While the app itself is amazing between the video demos, training options, workouts, and tracking available, the customer service is what has made me come and place this review. I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",0.53599405
1543,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. 

I like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.",0.53599405

Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",0.53599405
1545,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.",0.8865586

I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.90971184
1548,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.",0.53599405

If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry.

The workout I saw before subscription was good. After I paid … totally different and I’m not able to stop and fiddle on my phone in the bright sun.

It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

Due to a bad back I decided I wanted to try and learn techniques of swimming laps. This app gave me a workout but not what any of it means. What’s an FR, KI, IM, DR, etc? It’s not broken down into real basics. This appears more for someone who swam on team at some point. I don’t know technique and there are not videos for all the strokes.

1651,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting. 

I love myswimpro!!!",0.53599405

1817,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.53599405

1870,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.53599405
1871,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.53599405
1872,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.8137171
1873,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.53599405
1874,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.8515551
1875,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9961943
1876,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.53599405
1877,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.57752794
1878,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.85121447
1882,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything.

1990,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.53599405

Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",0.5454536
1993,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.89121073
1994,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.85377514
1995,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.53599405

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps.

Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.99834895
2000,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.53599405

The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9774771
2021,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9774771
2022,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.9774771

There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.9774771

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

2033,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

2035,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate.

All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.",0.9774771

Nope, I was greeted with tiny print telling me, nah, this app requires me to get permission! I’m sitting with my legs in the water and ready to start laps and no the app is NOT going to track my laps. And it didn’t. Useless! I paid for an app for swimming and it refused to work. If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry. I pay to swim and paid for an app. Useless!

The workout I saw before subscription was good. After I paid … totally different and I’m not able to stop and fiddle on my phone in the bright sun.  I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.

However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.9774771

Already seeing the bugs that previous reviewers have mentioned. Even though my settings across Garmin, this app, and my watch are all set to yards and miles, it kept switching back-and-forth between meters and yards and then it was short changing me on the yards. It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash. I like the idea of workouts but this is going to drive me nuts and not sure I’m willing to pay for something that doesn’t work properly.",0.9774771

I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well.

Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.,0.9774771
2060,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.,0.9774771

Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.",0.9774771

I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.

2064,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues.

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. 

Well you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.",0.9774771

I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements).

Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.9774771

Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.9774771

I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.8700366
2076,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.97991836
2077,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$.

Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank.

2081,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.43649942

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

It was enough of a bad experience within the first 5 minutes to turn me away given the high price tag. I would hope that this money would be put to good use developing a high quality app that works.",0.9803252
2101,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",I got this app so I can customize my workouts and swim at my own pace. After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.

2102,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. 

This behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. 

It’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.",0.9774771
2103,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",I found the description to be a bit misleading for a free app. Yes the app is free but there is nothing you can do with out the paid subscription. I’m training for a triathlon and wanted a good resource to help with swimming workouts but the 7 day trial isn’t a long enough evaluation period for me to see if I want to spend $20/month on an subscription.

2119,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

2321,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9774771

2374,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9774771
2375,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9774771
2376,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.98521125
2377,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.9774771
2378,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.22454225
2379,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.6373495
2380,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9774771
2381,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.9868052
2382,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

2383,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims.

I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.

2386,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.9774771

2498,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.22868098
2499,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9774771

2504,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout.

Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.86351246
2524,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.62651193
2525,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.62651193
2526,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.62651193

There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",0.62651193

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

2537,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

2539,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard.

2556,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

2557,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

The signup process was tedious, the amount of emails I have received already is overwhelming, and when I tried to watch some videos through the iOS and iPadOS app, the video would try to launch, but then it would close the video immediately after trying to watch.

After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.

2606,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. 

This behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. 

It’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.",0.62651193
2607,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,I found the description to be a bit misleading for a free app. Yes the app is free but there is nothing you can do with out the paid subscription. I’m training for a triathlon and wanted a good resource to help with swimming workouts but the 7 day trial isn’t a long enough evaluation period for me to see if I want to spend $20/month on an subscription. I can track swimming on my Apple Watch so I don’t need the app without the premium features at all.

2623,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

2825,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.62651193

1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.62651193
2879,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.62651193
2880,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.8732846
2881,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.7880034
2883,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.98033255

I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.62651193

2998,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.62651193

3001,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.8352692
3002,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.7906124
3003,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.62651193

Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.9985471
3008,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.62651193

Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.113830715
3030,Build your own custom workouts,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.

However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.113830715

It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash.

There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling.

Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything.

The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing.

There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?!

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s.

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.7461351

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.9921994

This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

3329,Build your own custom workouts,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.113830715

3382,Build your own custom workouts,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.113830715
3383,Build your own custom workouts,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.113830715
3384,Build your own custom workouts,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

3385,Build your own custom workouts,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book.

I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9343608

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

3502,Build your own custom workouts,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

3505,Build your own custom workouts,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.99981606
3506,Build your own custom workouts,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.99539596
3507,Build your own custom workouts,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.113830715

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.8731935
3512,Build your own custom workouts,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.113830715

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose.

But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.5808039

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.5808039
3533,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.5808039
3534,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes.

You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

3547,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better.

I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.9970337

It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing.

Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

3585,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.5808039
3586,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.5808039

I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.975256
3588,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data",So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.59044623
3589,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.5808039

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$.

Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank.

3593,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.9284226
3594,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

3833,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.5808039

3886,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.5808039
3887,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.5808039
3888,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data",I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.8439205
3889,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9900334

I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go.

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

4009,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data",VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.86541414
4010,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.82441205
4011,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.5808039

The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational.

4016,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.5808039

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.99003744

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

4036,Drill & technique video library,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.99003744
4037,Drill & technique video library,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.99003744
4038,Drill & technique video library,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. 

They are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. 

Save your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.",0.14080417
4052,Drill & technique video library,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.9983135
4053,Drill & technique video library,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.25039256
4054,Drill & technique video library,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. 

I definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.",0.99003744
4055,Drill & technique video library,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.6318571
4056,Drill & technique video library,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice.

Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored.

4063,Drill & technique video library,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans.

I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year.

4068,Drill & technique video library,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.99003744

Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

4095,Drill & technique video library,"UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$.

And it’s not every time. Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank.

4097,Drill & technique video library,"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.3712338
4098,Drill & technique video library,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

4152,Drill & technique video library,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.99150515

I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

4239,Drill & technique video library,All it does is provide an ad for the subscription services the offer. Click on anything within the app and you get an ad to upgrade to Pro.

4337,Drill & technique video library,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.99003744

4390,Drill & technique video library,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.99003744
4391,Drill & technique video library,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.99003744
4392,Drill & technique video library,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.97048545
4393,Drill & technique video library,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.99003744
4394,Drill & technique video library,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.15448533
4395,Drill & technique video library,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.5807803
4396,Drill & technique video library,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.99003744
4397,Drill & technique video library,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.9958385
4398,Drill & technique video library,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.

There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.15384376
4402,Drill & technique video library,"When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything.

4404,Drill & technique video library,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming.

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

4510,Drill & technique video library,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.99003744

Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",0.9915582
4513,Drill & technique video library,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.2339802
4514,Drill & technique video library,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.15868218
4515,Drill & technique video library,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.99003744

Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.6921265
4520,Drill & technique video library,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.99003744

Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more.

4538,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.40804717
4539,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

4540,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.40804717
4541,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.40804717
4542,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are.

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

4571,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can't create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.9602678
4572,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

I knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.",0.938883

But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

The signup process was tedious, the amount of emails I have received already is overwhelming, and when I tried to watch some videos through the iOS and iPadOS app, the video would try to launch, but then it would close the video immediately after trying to watch.

4621,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I got this app so I can customize my workouts and swim at my own pace. After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.

4622,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. 

This behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. 

It’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.",0.40804717

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

4841,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.40804717

4894,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.40804717
4895,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.40804717
4896,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.7209332
4897,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

4898,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.91851777
4899,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.99831265

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.40804717
4901,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.4531774

Developers are pretty responsive and open to feedback. 

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

5014,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.40804717

One of my problems is that I don’t have a 6 digit code come up on my watch, though I don’t know if the problems from the app or my watch. If I could get an answer that would be nose. Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",0.41828784
5017,Compete in monthly swim challenges,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9475171
5018,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.92018956
5019,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.40804717

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps.

Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.97949773
5024,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.40804717

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

5045,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9776728

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode.

I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

5057,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid.

5076,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

tl;dr. this app is only for swimmers who are primarily concerned with lap times and who don’t have a team and are willing to pay for a pretty expensive app.",0.92180896
5089,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. 

The latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. 

No matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!",0.9846263
5090,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season. This app’s workout structure is varied, purposeful, and expertly crafted - couldn’t ask for better. Also, in general, one of the best UI/UX designs in a fitness app I’ve ever used. If you swim or previously swam competitively in high school/college, get this app.",0.9776728
5091,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I’m done with this app. Don’t get me wrong this app is great and I’ve loved using it as I’ve gotten back into swimming. However somehow I got logged out of my account and couldn’t remember the password I used when I first set up the app. I’ve requested several password resets over the course of a week and have not received one in my inbox, spam, or junk folders. I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.",0.9776728
5092,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"First off I’m just starting off swimming and have used the app once with my watch and it seems to have done what I was hoping it would do.  I’m not a sophisticated swimmer so I can’t comment on all the analytics etc. 

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. 

Well you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.",0.9776728
5093,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Meh. It’s ok. Downloaded it for the drill/kick set mode. That part is fine. I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements). Lots of great potential here but a lot to be desired…maybe in time it’ll improve. At least I didn’t spend money on it.",0.9776728
5094,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Recently got a series 3 AppleWatch and was looking for a good swim workout app. Most of the reviews were positive for MSP so I thought I’d give it a shot. Prior to the recent update it was great, I’m not a pro swimmer so the basic features do just fine. Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming. I cleared the cache on my phone & watch, restarted the watch and it still doesn’t work right. I would have given it a higher mark because I like the app but it is now broken & virtually unusable to me...",0.9776728

All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",0.9776728
5097,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.",0.9776728
5098,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!",0.9776728

I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",0.869578
5100,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.98010325
5101,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.9776728
5102,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Up until this summer, I was able to create a simple workout and that was good for me - I know my times, I’m not looking to win medals or meets, but just wanted something that tracks workouts and tells me when to push off the wall. Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable. Even if they’d have offered an inexpensive option to just make your own workouts, I could be on board, but this isn’t worth the hassle.",0.9988547
5103,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$. 

DON’T waste your time or money. Try other apps.",0.9776728
5104,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"After using for approx 3 months, 2-3 times a week I have to say, I am not happy. Around 40-45 minutes into any workout, randomly the watch app closes. And it’s not every time. Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank. Which means it didn’t record over to Strava or my health app on Apple. Overall I like it, which is why it got 3. But it is very frustrating to find the app closed after a workout is not quite done.",0.9776728
5105,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.",0.43566293
5106,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

Again, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.",0.9776728

And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming.

5143,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:

* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.

* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.

5345,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9776728

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9776728
5399,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9776728
5400,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.9850515
5401,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

5402,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.22363634
5403,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.6366329

I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go.

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

5522,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.22777596
5523,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9776728

5528,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch.

Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.8170681

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

5849,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.8170681

5902,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.8170681
5903,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.88796556

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

6026,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.5912205
6027,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.8170681

6032,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.88263625

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route.

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate.

It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.88263625

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.88263625
6407,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.88263625

There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.99454266

I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.8236221

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

6530,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.4859389
6531,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.88263625

6536,Log the first workout in your recommended Training Plan,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout.

It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.19852063

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route.

- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

6857,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.19852063

6910,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.19852063
6911,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.19852063
6912,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.5519344
6913,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.982749

It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.961451

I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go.

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

7030,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.19852063

7033,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.9944975
7034,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.983526
7035,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.19852063

7040,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.19852063

This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.2040383

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

7060,Track total distance swum,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.2040383
7061,Track total distance swum,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.2040383
7062,Track total distance swum,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense.

I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",0.99768865
7092,Track total distance swum,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. 

The problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

7361,Track total distance swum,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.2040383

7414,Track total distance swum,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.2040383
7415,Track total distance swum,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.2040383
7416,Track total distance swum,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.5566229
7417,Track total distance swum,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

7419,Track total distance swum,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9629846

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.2040383

The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

I still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple's activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn't count drills?

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

7537,Track total distance swum,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.99389166
7538,Track total distance swum,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.9824921
7539,Track total distance swum,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.2040383

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps.

Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.914034
7544,Track total distance swum,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.2040383

The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.9876554

I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.9876554

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).

There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

7865,View logged workouts on your profile,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.9876554

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.9876554
7919,View logged workouts on your profile,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9876554

My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

8042,View logged workouts on your profile,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.17447451
8043,View logged workouts on your profile,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.9876554

8048,View logged workouts on your profile,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.9876554

And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.70710677

My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode.

- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).

8369,Earn achievement badges,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.70710677

8422,Earn achievement badges,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.70710677
8423,Earn achievement badges,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.70710677

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.95324904

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

8546,Earn achievement badges,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.71977645
8547,Earn achievement badges,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.70710677

8552,Earn achievement badges,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",0.22213565

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).

My frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",0.22213565

8926,Follow friends,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",0.22213565
8927,Follow friends,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.22213565

My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.57191485
8929,Follow friends,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9678122

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

9046,Follow friends,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",0.22213565

9049,Follow friends,VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.,0.99167705
9050,Follow friends,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",0.97887284
9051,Follow friends,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",0.22213565

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps.

Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.9213905
9056,Follow friends,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",0.22213565
