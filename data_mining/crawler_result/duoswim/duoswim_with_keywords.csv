0,"Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It‚Äôs less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.
I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it‚Äôs for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.",5,"Amazing app, some improvements needed","['swimming pool', 'Fantastic app', 'Apple Watch layout', 'Apple Watch', 'Fantastic', 'pool', 'app', 'workout', 'changed', 'swimming']","['fantastic app', 'great app', 'apple watch', 'app stars', 'app', 'swimmers helpful', 'info app', 'pause workout', 'workout able', 'way workout']"
1,"Finally a swim app that looks great and provides superb workouts. The recent addition of the swims and sprints feature has been very well received, and keeps you motivated to archive a goal distance. It would be fun to have additional functions like ‚Äúcreate your own workout‚Äù or ‚Äòrandom workout‚Äô. 

Overall, I am extremely impressed with the app and the integration with apple watch, functionally it is great. Having some extra metrics would be cool and badges on the profile, but this isn‚Äôt a priority. Thumbs up from me and 5 stars.",5,A brilliant app,"['superb workouts', 'Finally a swim', 'swim app', 'Finally', 'goal distance', 'superb', 'recent addition', 'sprints feature', 'motivated to archive', 'archive a goal']","['swim app', 'apple watch', 'impressed app', 'app', 'swims sprints', 'create workout', 'swim', 'sprints feature', 'workout random', 'finally swim']"
2,"Positive: The coaching side seems ok and decent price compared to others. Needs Improvement: Watch app The watch up has a very basic screen in pool swim mode. Only distance, time, heart rate and calories. Split time can‚Äôt be changed while swimming, you are stuck with it when you begin, need to be chosen. No time/100m etc available. Apple fitness integration. Pool swim recorded as open water swim in Apple Fitness. No detail on splits / sets available in Apple fitness. Just distance and heart rate during swim. So integration not working too well. iPhone application Coaching section looks ok but I‚Äôve not tested it. There is only a high level summary available on swims: Distance, Duration, Pace (over whole session including rest), Calories, Average Heart Rate over whole session. So fairly useless to track how well one has done by set. Since I have a coach, cancelled subscription. Not useful for me.",2,"Watch app is very limited, integration apple fitness weak.","['decent price compared', 'decent price', 'price compared', 'Apple fitness', 'Apple', 'heart rate', 'Positive', 'coaching side', 'Watch', 'fitness']","['rate swim', 'apple fitness', 'available swims', 'swim integration', 'swim apple', 'fitness integration', 'swims distance', 'swim recorded', 'pool swim', 'swim mode']"
3,"This app is very easy to use. I love how you can send and sync workouts to your watch ‚Äì this can take a few tries, but I don‚Äôt fault DuoSwim for this since every phone-watch connected app has this problem. Swim workouts are tailored for all abilities from beginner swimmers to advanced. 

You can also log kick and drills on the apple watch when you choose an open goal swim, this is very useful to get the correct swim distance. Overall, a very promising app that has potential to be great! Great job guys! üèäüèäüëç",5,Great for all swimmers!,"['app', 'phone-watch connected app', 'Swim', 'n‚Äôt fault DuoSwim', 'easy', 'workouts', 'connected app', 'watch', 'send and sync', 'n‚Äôt fault']","['workouts watch', 'apple watch', 'phone watch', 'sync workouts', 'promising app', 'app potential', 'duoswim phone', 'app easy', 'beginner swimmers', 'app']"
4,Perfect app. Used to love swimming but hadn‚Äôt regularly swam for many years. This app has helped me on a journey and I now look forward to my regular swims 3 times a week. Im working through the training plans and love the ease of recording sessions and the regular updates. Well done highly recommended to anyone wanting to get back in the pool or for those wanting professional detailed sessions.,5,Got me back into the pool - loving it !!,"['Perfect app', 'Perfect', 'n‚Äôt regularly swam', 'app', 'love', 'n‚Äôt regularly', 'regularly swam', 'regular', 'times a week', 'sessions']","['swims times', 'app used', 'perfect app', 'love swimming', 'app', 'swimming hadn', 'swimming', 'regular swims', 'years app', 'swims']"

6,"This is the first app I have found where I can have access to a variety of training sessions that I can follow to improve my swimming. The range of drills used in the sessions keeps it interesting.  A great addition to the app is the videos, this is perfect for visualising and learning skills. The training journey enables me to track my progress and the attention to detail to ensure you can see results is amazing. I love that there is inspiration for nutrition with recipes to try too! I recommend for anyone wanting to improve their swimming in any capacity.",5,Amazing tool for swim training,"['follow to improve', 'training sessions', 'sessions', 'variety of training', 'found', 'access', 'variety', 'follow', 'app', 'range of drills']","['improve swimming', 'swimming range', 'training sessions', 'training journey', 'swimming', 'follow improve', 'app', 'swimming capacity', 'training', 'addition app']"
7,Very nice app not so complicated as others. I will start my journey from tomorrow. It might be nice if you add a pdf format for the workouts. Just a suggestion really. Also as a master swimmer I would appreciate some plans based on ages/ability etc. As I purchased the gold membership it would be nice to add some more options for the nutrition section and maybe some advise for dry land exercises before swimming?
