4,"They put me on 2 levels before champion but the workouts are way too easy. I also told the survey, I swim for 2 hrs and a minimum of 5000 yards. The training they give me is less than 2 hrs and WAY less than 5000 yards.",2,Honest oppinion of a 17 year old on a swim team
6,"I love Swimup’s YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It’s a nice minimalistic app that’s simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn’t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup’s YouTube videos because of the explanations. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn’t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",3,"I really want to like the app, I really do"
