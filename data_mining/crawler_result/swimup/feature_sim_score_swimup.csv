0,personalized training plans,"Amazing app, amazing coach and superb courses. I am enjoying the app so much and it motivates me to go at least twice a week for swim. I find courses are very well made and help any aspiring swimmer at all levels. 
I used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. 
Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",0.35473

2,personalized training plans,"I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach. After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it’s videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I’m impressed!",0.35473

6,personalized training plans,"I love Swimup’s YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It’s a nice minimalistic app that’s simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn’t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup’s YouTube videos because of the explanations. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn’t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",0.35473
