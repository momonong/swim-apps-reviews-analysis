0,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",4,My Swim Pro Review,"['weeks ago', 'years of swimming', 'made more progress', 'app', 'ability', 'swim', 'unreasonably high expectations', 'minor bugs', 'features', 'weeks']","['swimming customized', 'app smartwatch', 'great app', 'additional features', 'working swim', 'loving app', 'swim excellent', 'app additional', 'app certainly', 'swim equipment']"
1,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",5,Great investment,"['competíos swimmer', 'wanted to push', 'based', 'workout', 'times', 'competíos', 'swimmer', 'enjoy', 'wanted', 'push']","['workout swimming', 'swim times', 'swimming tips', 'swimming workouts', 'competíos swimmer', 'swimmer enjoy', 'technique swim', 'workout based', 'swimming', 'swim']"
2,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",5,From Analytics to Coaching,"['app', 'long time swimmer', 'impressed', 'Apple Watch', 'Activities', 'Apple', 'Watch', 'workouts', 'wanted', 'long time']","['app workout', 'swim program', 'customizable workouts', 'apple watch', 'workouts example', 'watch phone', 'app designed', 'use watch', 'app', 'app understand']"
3,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",5,You can’t believe all that’s packed into this subscription.,"['competitive swimming years', 'competitive swimming', 'swimming years', 'swim', 'years', 'n’t', 'taking years', 'honest', 'competitive', 'swimming']","['swim program', 'swim plans', 'swim community', 'swim experts', 'app phone', 'competitive swimming', 'global swim', 'built swim', 'swim ps', 'master swim']"
4,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",4,Great but not fail safe,"['dedicated swimmer', 'helpful and motivating', 'app', 'great app', 'foremost SwimPro', 'swimmer', 'yards', 'foremost', 'great', 'helpful']","['swimpro great', 'swimpro accurately', 'swimpro', 'trusting swimpro', 'app workout', 'foremost swimpro', 'health apps', 'counter apps', 'app features', 'app lap']"
5,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",2,Complicated,"['complicated app', 'app', 'complicated', 'plan', 'Added', 'beginner plan', 'literally did n’t', 'beginner', 'times', 'swimming']","['swimplan', 'workout swimplan', 'swimplan track', 'freestyle plan', 'swimming practice', 'technical swimming', 'enjoy swimming', 'swimming', 'complicated app', 'app beginners']"
6,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",5,Great for Pool and Open Water,"['Apple watch', 'watch', 'Apple', 'mode', 'airplane mode', 'airplane', 'app', 'Apple Watch software', 'lap swimming including', 'automatically']","['myswimpro app', 'swim watch', 'apple watch', 'watch software', 'unrelated myswimpro', 'myswimpro', 'tracks yardage', 'used myswimpro', 'automatically tracks', 'workouts automatically']"
7,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself!

8,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",5,"Very useful, but a few issues","['MSP', '’ve', 'Watch', 'Apple Watch', 'workouts', 'week', 'swimming', 'helpful', 'times', 'training']","['workouts watch', 'workout watch', 'using msp', 'msp', 'workouts loaded', 'messes workout', 'apple watch', 'msp months', 'modifications watch', 'training plans']"
9,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",3,I bet it works great with Apple watches…,"['Save your money', 'Garmin Connect', 'watch', 'Garmin', 'Pool Swimming', 'Garmin watch', 'app', 'workout', 'Training Peaks', 'Save']","['workouts garmin', 'workout synced', 'garmin watch', 'workout watch', 'workouts watch', 'app garmin', 'swim app', 'garmin pool', 'garmin connect', 'app watch']"
10,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.

11,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.",3,Great idea w/ ok execution.

12,"I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  

Aside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan.

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do.

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start.

23,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",4,It’s great now,"['write this review', 'open water', 'open water swims', '’ve waited', 'open water performance', 'MSP was decent', 'open water swimming', 'open', 'water', 'waited a year']","['device swim', 'water performance', 'swims team', 'swim partner', 'water swimming', 'swimming', 'msp decent', 'swim', 'review msp', 'swimming doing']"
24,"Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Unfavorable characteristics:
If I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.

My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment.

Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming. I cleared the cache on my phone & watch, restarted the watch and it still doesn’t work right. I would have given it a higher mark because I like the app but it is now broken & virtually unusable to me...",2,Recent Update Issues,"['good swim workout', 'swim workout app', 'good swim', 'swim workout', 'workout app', 'positive for MSP', 'Recently', 'series', 'AppleWatch', 'app']","['series applewatch', 'applewatch', 'watch restarted', 'app broken', 'applewatch looking', 'workout app', 'restarted watch', 'swimming cleared', 'phone watch', 'msp']"

57,"Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so.

Recently improved to recognize kicking.

Yesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s.

It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.",2,"Great App, updates are too much","['SINGLE TIME', 'long time', 'add a set', 'monthly or annually', 'subscribe monthly', 'time', 'time I clicked', 'SINGLE', 'save', 'swim workout']","['ad subscribe', 'log workout', 'subscribe monthly', 'app', 'app simply', 'effort app', 'just log', 'simply log', 'personalization', 'log swim']"

61,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",5,"In theory great, in practice it’s so annoying","['title suggests', 'workout', 'awesome app', 'program', 'Strava', 'suggests', 'theory', 'Activity app', 'app', 'title']","['app workout', 'strava workouts', 'activity app', 'synced strava', 'awesome app', 'workouts 0s', 'workout gets', 'workout preferences', 'times workout', '800 workout']"

It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable.

Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. 

UPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.

After using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. 

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.

Now I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

I need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

305,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",3,Bummer.,"['lap', 'pressed start', 'rep', 'custom workout', 'set', 'start', 'app', '’ve', 'excited to start', 'workout']","['count laps', 'custom workout', 'spinning watch', 'interrupt swimming', 'laps set', 'swimming rep', 'apple watch', 'workout select', 'laps', 'watch lap']"

358,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",3,Mixed Feelings,"['Apple activity app', 'app', 'Apple activity', 'activity app', 'Apple', 'PROS', 'activity', 'Watch', 'Apple Watch', 'workout']","['workouts app', 'app watch', 'app swim', 'apple watch', 'swim times', 'customize workouts', 'different workouts', 'watch tested', 'activity app', 'water app']"
359,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

360,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities.

478,"I don't know where to begin. 

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",2,Needs Work,"['workout', 'app', 'watch app', 'times', 'sets', 'set', 'watch', 'time', 'watch app crashes', 'Apple Watch']","['workout watch', 'workout app', 'watch app', 'custom workout', 'apple watch', 'creating workout', 'workout timing', 'basic watch', 'pause workout', 'track time']"

482,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",2,Very limited app,"['app', 'Apple Watch', 'Watch', 'swimming', 'Apple', 'swimmer', 'distance', 'stroke', 'swimming app', 'estimated']","['swimming app', 'swimmer app', 'app swimming', 'mediocre app', 'apple watch', 'great app', 'beginner swimmers', 'experienced swimmer', 'revolutionary app', 'resistance watch']"
483,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",1,lost workout - difficulty creating custom workouts,"['app', 'watch app', 'watch', 'good app', 'watch app simply', 'workout', 'interval training workout', 'open interval sets', 'interval', 'good']","['watch app', 'app watch', 'good app', 'app potential', 'rate app', 'award watch', 'app', 'creating app', 'created workouts', 'app revised']"

488,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",2,MySwimPro by MyProgrammingAmateur,"['workout', 'app', 'n’t', 'today', 'watch', 'watch app', 'update', 'day', 'Workouts app', 'Apple']","['workouts app', 'workout watch', 'watch app', 'workout trial', 'watch fixed', 'tracking workout', 'workout button', 'workout crapped', 'restarted workout', 'rebooting watch']"
