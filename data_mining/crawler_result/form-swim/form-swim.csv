0,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I‚Äôve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch‚Äôs inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It‚Äôs my only future feature request!",5,Amazing! Now even better üòÉ
1,"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can‚Äôt see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",5,Very motivating
2,"This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don‚Äôt know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!",5,I love these goggles
3,"The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don‚Äôt have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There‚Äôs no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don‚Äôt take the proper steps of progression then I don‚Äôt get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",3,"It‚Äôs fine, but not revolutionary"
4,"This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. 

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. 

Thanks for a game changing product!",5,Made me fall back in love with swimming
5,"I love the product and app. Everything is done very well and I can‚Äôt imagine my life without the googles. Some reviews claim that this product should be for serious swimmers. I am a terrible form, overweight guy trying to lose 100 pounds and this app and googles have already made a big difference and I‚Äôm swimming longer. So thankful for this product. It is for everyone!",5,Great product and app one suggestion
6,"I love these goggles so much, but when it comes to charging them the goggles won‚Äôt charge well. I‚Äôll put them on the charger and the red light comes on. I‚Äôve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light. I understand that the goggles are new and still working through updates and I really appreciate what this company has done for swimming!",4,Charger problems
7,"I like the FORM goggles and what they provide, but I just cannot understand why I need to pay an extra $19 a month to import workouts I write myself into a product I already own. 

If I wanted to access the library, or share workouts with my friends (spoiler - I have none. I‚Äôm a triathlete‚Ä¶ lol) that would be one thing. But it seems exploitative to force me to pay a recurring fee to use even the most basic feature.

I just want to see my own workouts in front of me. Why do I have to send money to other people for that privilege?!",2,Good Goggles - Do Not Like Plan Structure
8,I don‚Äôt understand their pricing but right now I don‚Äôt care because I like this app and my goggles so much. It was always so annoying to me to have to remember my labs. How to stop and click a clicker or write something down.  No more. I just swim. I just got the polar optical sensor I haven‚Äôt quite figured out how to connect it but when I do I may write more,5,Just the best deal going
9,"After admiring them for awhile, I‚Äôm very grateful to have been gifted a pair of Form goggles by my teammate. I‚Äôm fascinated by all the metrics available upon synching and am very happy with the very user friendly interface!  I really look forward to learning more about my swims afterwards as well as seeing the real time info available as I swim!!!",5,Excellent
10,"I was really disappointed to learn the collected data from the Form Goggles cannot be pushed to Garmin Connect. Form should take a look at how Zwift (for cycling) does it because it cannot be that hard!

UPDATE:
Response from Form: ‚ÄúUnfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.‚Äù

My Response:
First, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I‚Äôm sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin‚Äôs limitation? 

BTW, I‚Äôve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.",3,Doesn‚Äôt Push Data to Garmin Connect
11,I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace,4,Really good googles and app
12,"Goggles/software do function well and as advertised. However, subscription price for workouts in addition to the high initial cost of buying their product is a slap in the face. Almost every other sport tracking wearable gives you the ability to integrate workouts with no extra cost. I will stick to manually performing workouts with the unsubscribed version until they break, then likely seek a different brand.",3,Subscription??
13,If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form. Would be cool to see an estimated distance so I don‚Äôt have to do the math myself.,4,Open Water distance swim without GPS
14,"I bought the goggles for the real-time telemetry.  The true potential was the workouts.  I stay engaged and improving without boredom.  I use a plentiful variety of structured workouts that use drills, equipment and just plain fun to pour on the power!  My times are improving too.",5,Unlock Your Potential!
15,"I have these googles and they are pretty neat.  I‚Äôm fortunate to be grandfathered in and the workouts features are nice.  I‚Äôm very disappointed that Form decided to move to a subscription model for any future users.  You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

See below the email I received from FORM.

If you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26. Real-time metrics in pool, open water, and swim spa are now part of the FORM membership. New swimmers will be required to have an active membership to access this and all member features.",1,Buyer Beware - Subscription Required to Use Goggles
16,"Form is the best in swimming metrics. The display quality and comfort of the googles are uniquely awesome, as well as the app! The only missing feature to be able set a certain distance to reach for the ability to count down and show the remaining distance. This is a base for a long distance swimmer.",4,Awesome with a small miss
17,"I have been using the goggles regularly for both pool and OW swims. Both with Apple Watch and Garmin connect as the goggles when used for OW simply function as a display while the Watch control the recording and swim.

1. Current pace not available, only average page for entire workout
2. HR displayed after pausing workout is wrong, both in FORM app and goggles. Heart rate shown is 20 BPM above actual rate and when examine using the FORM app the entire second half of the swim has HR increased by 20 BPM compared to first half.

In short totally unreliable data.

Furthermore this kind of errors are obvious software bugs and reveals that the goggles have not been tested properly when used for OW swims.

The only thing the goggles can be used for during OW swim is to display the total distance.",1,Unfinished product with serious shortcomings
18,"Compared to regular swim googles these googles reduce your vision by about 50 percent. That‚Äôs a big trade off to have have data that is available, slightly delayed, from other sources like Apple Watch and and pool time clocks.  Open water swimming requires navigation and spotting landmarks.  This is extremely difficult with the tunnel vision and smoked tint of these google.  Feels like you are swimming in a cave.  Fit is average as the googles can be worn with either side up which is sub-optimal for a good fit.",1,Wait for later generations
19,"The googles are great! The app is also clean and easy to use. However, as a competitive swimmer many of the workouts are very simple. I would like the ability to create my own workouts so then I have complete control on the workouts and then could align with my workout schedule.",3,Needs the Ability to Create Custom Workouts
20,These goggles are fantastic and the app is the perfect complement. It lets me dig into my swim data to track my performance improvement. The app is well laid out and intuitive and allows you to share workout data among friends.,5,Great new product for swimmers
21,"These puppies are amazing! The AR display helps me track my laps and splits and times and distance and calories. WHILE I swim! It‚Äôs amazing and I love them. Plus, their customer service is excellent. 10/10 thank you FORM! Legiiiiiit.",5,Will Never Swim Without My FORM Goggles!
22,"I use a Garmin watch and Garmin connect to track my swims. Form will retrieve my data from the watch but if I just use the goggle data it won‚Äôt interface with Garmin connect. Also I accidentally deleted a swim and there is no way to re-retrieve the data or copy yesterday‚Äôs swim. It‚Äôs a new app so I get it. The goggles are awesome, clear and informative.",3,Can only get better
23,The app is good: responsive and user friendly.  It‚Äôs great to see all the stats in one place as well as all of my workouts. Video tutorials of the drills are also very helpful,5,Love it so far
24,"I was a bit skeptical about these goggles and did not believe the hype, then I tried them. Wow, what a remarkable change to my training and focus. I love them.",5,"Wow, what a game changer"
25,I am enjoying the glasses and app.  Joining is too expensive considering I had to buy the goggles and already pay for pool time. Will hold on that for now,5,review
26,"Please let me have more stats on real time like I can choose for turn and rest.

Thanks!",5,Great! Plus Feature request
27,Cannot wait to monitor my heartbeat live. Thank you Form Team.,5,When are we getting the new version compatible with Polar OH1+?
28,There is no app support. Multiple attempts at contact have gone unanswered for weeks. No ability to create your own workout and download to goggles. Have to join a subscription service for workouts. There are some included with the app but seem ti be geared to the novice swimmer.,1,No support
29,Form goggles are awesome.  Takes your swimming to a whole other level! And their customer service is top notch.,5,Awesome goggles!
30,"Love the new graphs in the app, and excited to try out some of the new dashboard options",5,Great update!
31,"So cool to get a quick in depth review of a swim. Broken down by stoke, stroke count, and interval!!!
Not to mention the exact rest interval, without ever looking at the clock!!!!",5,Form rocks
32,Going to have to share this with our other alumni swimmers. Great product! App is cool too.,5,Finally!
33,This app is an unexpectedly amazing bonus to using the FORM Swim Goggles.  It feels like Strava for swimmers.  Nice work to all the developers who put this together.  üëå,5,Serious Amazing App
34,Never could keep track of laps and stats. These goggles help me know where I am at and keeps me motivated.,5,Newbie
35,Paired easily with my goggles.  Syncs fairly quickly.  The data is rich and useful.  Helps round a pretty damned strong training experience with the form goggles,4,Straightforward data driven app
36,These goggles are great motivation to get to the pool and get fit.  Great value. Great support.   Changed swimming for this 67 year old.,5,Great Swim Coach
37,"In a pair with Sony Waterproof headphones the googles motivates me to do more swim laps. 
Headphones keeps me entertained, and the googles tells me where I am at.",5,Great product
38,Great tool for anyone who is interested in quantifying their performance and efficiency.  Goggles are comfortable to wear and easy to use,5,Excellent
39,Need to be able to export data excel or a graphing widget to analyze long term trends,5,Need an export or graphing option
40,Heads up display while swimming revolutionizes and revitalized swim practice.,5,What a great device
41,These are great goggles!  I use them for pool swims and endless pool.  The pulse accessory works well.  I wish they‚Äôd partner with endless pool.,4,Great pool swim & endless pool
42,How many times do I have to say 'no thanks to join your free trial? It's however many times a week I Swim! Stop harassing me,2,Goggles amazing..app annoying
43,Make make your Coaches redundant.,5,Great Motivator.
44,The software is decent. The actual goggles have poor field of vision for sighting in open water,2,Decent pool. OWS needs work
45,for some reason the app doesnt work for me.,3,"Good build, but couldnt get past the ‚Äòcreate a bio‚Äô page on the app."
46,The fit is superb. The lap count and total distance cover are inaccurate. I noticed that the unit misses flip turns occasionally.,3,Good goggles.
47,"I love the Goggles, but then they forced me to write a review losing good will.",5,Ughhhh
48,App is not intuitive and difficult to navigate on phone. Googles are horribly inconsistent in tracking laps.  Very disappointed.,1,Not intuitive
49,The goggles are the best thing in the pool I just wish it would connect to the apple health app,3,Wish it synced with health kit
50,My one complaint is the main stats can‚Äôt include Average Pace / 100 yards!,3,Need Average pace / 100 yard
51,Every penny!,5,Worth
52,The best gift ever!!!!,5,So impressed
53,Love my new goggles.,5,New
54,Love this technology!,5,5 STAR
55,Pog u,5,Good stuff
56,New software update broke the goggles,1,Goggles are stuck in ‚Äúupdating goggles‚Äù
57,As described in title,1,Unable to select goggle name in pairing setup. So far no luck with the app.
58,It recognizes freestyle but all my breast strokes are considered resting üò¢ - I‚Äôm in a swim spa.,1,Bad at stroke detection
59,"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM‚Äôs only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ‚Ä¶.FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",2,Does not sync to Apple Health
60,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn‚Äôt purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you‚Äôll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don‚Äôt own any other devices because I don‚Äôt compete much and I‚Äôm not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I‚Äôve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don‚Äôt own other devices, I‚Äôve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I‚Äôve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I‚Äôve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach‚Äôs mantra: ‚ÄúIf unsure, do more.‚Äù So I‚Äôd do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It‚Äôs one thing to have a good turnover but if you‚Äôre just windmilling down the lane it‚Äôs no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I‚Äôm very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....ü§£",5,Great Training Tech
61,"Great app, great goggles!",5,"Great app, great goggles!"
