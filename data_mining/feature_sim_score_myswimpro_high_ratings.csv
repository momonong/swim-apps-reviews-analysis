0,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.3276952
1,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.95068884
2,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.95068884
3,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.95068884
4,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.3101463
5,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.33079964
6,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",0.3457229
7,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.6498279
8,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.44058684
9,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.",0.3243546
10,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it. 

I can’t wait to see what goals I hit from now til winter! And I love that you can use GPS for free open water swim or put in how long your pool is. I also can’t wait to do this at the beach!",0.95068884
11,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am at 67 a new swimmer . I cannot begin to explain the benefit that this app and the outstanding customer support has bestowed to me. I started out needing to rest after 25 meters . Going to the pool to swim was a source of anxiety and I went because I knew it was in my best interest. Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training . You want to just swim go ahead and enjoy but if you want to improve and become engaged in a fun healthy sport ? Stop wasting your time sign up and join all of us at MySeimPro community . Go ahead , I dare you !",0.95068884
12,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.37105823
13,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.95068884
14,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.95068884
15,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.3101463
16,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved. 

I recently had an issue with my account and the customer service was on point. I got an immediate response and my issue was resolved with that one response. Keep up the great work, MySwimPro!",0.95068884
17,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.32072902
18,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"While the app itself is amazing between the video demos, training options, workouts, and tracking available, the customer service is what has made me come and place this review. I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",0.3405455
19,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This app is amazing and the customer service is awesome! I had been a swimmer growing up and always had access to a coach. But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming. I’ve lost more weight than I thought I could, I’m swimming faster now than when I was a kid and I feel like I’m apart of a community. This app really changed my life for the better.",0.987859
20,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I really do like this app. I love that it gives analytics on distance per stroke. I wear an Apple
Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",0.9964352
21,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Live the app! The best part I enjoy are all the videos and how exercises are explained throughly. There are lots of exercises in workouts and videos to explain before activities, and you can change during workouts. 

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.95068884
22,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I am in my late 50s, was a swimmer in HS and college and really came back to the sport because I needed low impact on my knees. I have loved this app for almost 3 yrs. 
I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim. 
Go MSP Team!",0.95068884
23,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.95068884
24,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This isn’t really a critique it’s more me asking if a feature could be added. I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well. 

Thank you.",0.95068884
25,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid. Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.,0.95068884
26,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I began training and racing in triathlons last year. Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.",0.7191913
27,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"When I first download the app they had an update, and none of the tutorials videos works. Upon contacting customer support they were more than helpful and provided working links to all the video within a timely manner. In addition, you can download all the swim workout as a pdf and print it out. However, It a bit of a bum but understandable that the garmin sync for easy workout transfer doesn’t work. However I was surprised they even offered the feature they also have it for Fitbit and Apple Watch.",0.95068884
28,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I have been using My Swim Pro for about two months and I am truly amazed at the ability of the app to create bespoke training plans for me.   Time seems to fly by now in the pool.  My technique and fitness are very clearly improving and I am enjoying the global MSP community tremendously.   I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.  Thank you SO much My Swim Pro!,0.95068884
29,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. 

The latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. 

No matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!",0.95391065
30,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"My sister and I have taken up swimming in our 40’s after many years of running injuries. We grew up in Florida so we could swim before we could walk but never swam on a team.  We initially joined a Adult Summer swim league and had a blast!!

31,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season.

I’ve programmed in my workout, my watch vibrates (“swim now” prompt), I swim my 50m interval, touch the wall and wait for the next prompt.   No need to look at the watch…just wait for the next prompt and go (interval training).

Great product and great customer service, five stars.",0.95068884
34,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.95068884
35,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Not only is this the best fitness app I’ve used, it might be one of the best apps I’ve ever used period. I’ve gone from swimming with no plan or intent to doing structured workouts and have improved immensely in only a couple weeks. The Apple Watch app can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly. I love the short videos they provide on technique as well. Highly recommend if you’re serious about improving your swimming!",0.95068884
36,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I had just started swimming again after not swimming for years and had recently became a lifeguard (again). I wanted to swim faster than my coworkers but just general fitness in general, so I took it upon myself for one of their annual sales for a year. Did it.

All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",0.9538023
37,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.95068884
38,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

Again, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.",0.95068884
39,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.  The Apps on iPhone and Apple Watch are both very well done and stable.  The paid subscription is well worth it.,0.3510775
40,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I will say that this app finally got me back to swimming after 4 years of not being able to get back in the pool. I can’t get into a swim team because of reasons so I had the worst time in making workouts for me. This app is worth its money!

44,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I really like the ability to write my own workouts with intervals and rest times.  The cool thing is it buzzes when I need to go on the next ‘rep’.  I’m also counting challenged and sometimes forget where I am in a 400 or 500 - a quick glance can confirm where I am on that rep.

When it was installed, I was trying to figure it out; when I set it all up, I chose a workout, then I went on my Fitbit, and then I tap load work out. It said,” connect to phone, error with the connection. ” but so far, I wouldn't grade this app for a lousy star rating. I think it needs to be connected to pads and iPhones. Even I am connected to the wifi; it does it too.",0.95068884
47,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I was a seasonal competitive swimmer but during the off-season I didn’t have any coaching. This app helped me improve my swimming in the same way a coach would.

Thankfully, I got back in the water after a near 20 year hiatus. MySwimPro was a fundamentally significant part of my return not just to the pool and swimming, but even a bit of racing here and there. 5 medals in 5 races at my first Masters Nationals gave me the jolt to keep swimming and keep working.

60,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I love this app, it makes swimming fun and I look forward to using it every day. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it does not keep track of my lap times very well which in turn messes up the swolf score, my best times and lap splits, etc. That being said, I have tried the available swim apps and this is still the best swim app out there!",0.95721436
61,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I love this app! As a swimmer this app is super user friendly and simple. I don’t have the premium version but the free routines they have are still good quality.

68,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do.

69,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.",0.32564843
70,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.95068884
71,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,0.33790082
72,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",0.9562263
73,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I usually don’t leave reviews but really wanted to support the guys building MySwimPro. My swimming has taken off since I started using the app on my Watch.

75,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,0.42146838
76,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"This is a good app. I like it. But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well. At least I can connect my Fitbit to it and use the app into a train by session. You can log workouts and it’s very helpful! I only gave it four stars because there should be at least 2 free workouts.",0.95395255

82,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼,0.95536166
83,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts.

85,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.9576589
86,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting. 

I love myswimpro!!!",0.95068884

149,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,Off to a great start in pool and dry land. Love the app,0.627629
150,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.95068884
151,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.95068884
152,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.95068884
153,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.95068884
154,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.3101463
155,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.95068884
156,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.95068884
157,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.95068884
158,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it's totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!",0.95068884
159,MySwimPro Coach unlocks:,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.95068884

There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.32318988

The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.95529836

387,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.19453011
388,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.9843301
389,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.9843301
390,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.9843301
391,Personalized swim Training Plans,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.17633541
392,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.19775401
393,Personalized swim Training Plans,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!",0.21327364
394,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.5390202
395,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.31282666

BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.",0.19106273
397,Personalized swim Training Plans,"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it.

Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan .

399,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.23970665
400,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.9843301
401,Personalized swim Training Plans,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.9843301
402,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.17633541

That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved.

Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.18730159

I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data.

I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming.

I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",0.99856263

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.9843301

I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim.

410,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.9843301

I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well.

Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train.

424,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.9843301

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

Since I started with MySwimPro I felt the best professional coach I can ask for is back with me always whenever I need it.",0.9865287
450,Personalized swim Training Plans,MySwimPro sets the ‘gold standard’.   I’ve hesitated to write a review until I really put this app thru it’s paces. It has been almost 4 years  since I started using MySwimPro.   Communication with there team is excellent.  The diversity of workouts is endless and there are training plans for every need from the beginner to the triathlete or masters swimmer.,0.98662394
451,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I encountered some issues that stopped the app from working at one point.  Thankfully, installing the most recent version fixed them.

The app makes it reasonably easy to write up and execute your own workouts.  Times recorded are not very accurate, but that may be more a function of the Apple watch than the app - each swim may be off by several seconds.",0.19127324
452,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I switched from Apple Watch app because I’m looking to get more accurate info on my work out. I’m having trouble to connect to Facebook to connect with people, it keeps on kicking me back out. Now on my Facebook page it shows I have the app connected and it gave me my work out notification. But I’m not able to connect on MySwimPro. I didn’t upgrade, is that why it’s not working?? Please help.",0.9843301
453,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I was in the process of completing one of the training plans when I took a 6 week break for vacation. I needed to restart the program and no matter what I did on the app, I wasn’t able to go back to the first set of workouts. I emailed support through the app and received instantaneous responses fixing the issue in a matter of moments. Love this app!!!",0.1942624
454,Personalized swim Training Plans,I have been using the app a few months and have actually switched to an annual subscription due to the value I gained from it. It is the next best thing to having a live coach and their customer service is the best I have seen from any app developer. Definitely a smart investment for any level swimmer.,0.98633856
455,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do. It also forces me to do the sets at the correct training paces. I highly recommend it for anyone unable to join a team.",0.99266917
456,Personalized swim Training Plans,"When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.",0.19240545
457,Personalized swim Training Plans,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.9843301
458,Personalized swim Training Plans,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,0.20513438
459,Personalized swim Training Plans,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",0.9874036
460,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I usually don’t leave reviews but really wanted to support the guys building MySwimPro. My swimming has taken off since I started using the app on my Watch. The workouts are great and very motivational. I don’t have the time to attend a club, but having a training plan and guidance through the workout has proved very valuable. Thank you!",0.98646176
461,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Fantastic app, total game changer. Gives new meaning to your swimming especially in conjunction with an Apple Watch. I bought one just for this reason. It is that good.

Can't wait to see where this is going in the future, in particular with respect to even more personalization and community!",0.2508024
462,Personalized swim Training Plans,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,0.29263306
463,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This is a good app. I like it. But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well. At least I can connect my Fitbit to it and use the app into a train by session. You can log workouts and it’s very helpful! I only gave it four stars because there should be at least 2 free workouts.",0.98616034
464,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I wish there was an app like this for every exercise. Would be great for track running and interval type workouts. Even regular lifting to a schedule would be great with this type of app.

Would love the opportunity to build my own workouts, but the workouts they provide are well done.",0.9866292
465,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I was using the Apple Watch swim activity and that normally worked fine but I was doing lengths with little purpose. MySwimPro has me working on improving my technique leading to better times and increased fitness. Plus, having a workout to complete means I normally end up doing more than I was before.",0.9870304

468,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Actually closer than 2nd ... this app gives serious swimmers so much, to complain about its kinks is  ungenerous. That the app isn’t super slick is beside the point. That watches don’t do as advertised in many situations is not Myswimpro’s fault. This app opens a world of coaching and training advice. I love it.",0.9863456
469,Personalized swim Training Plans,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼,0.986934
470,Personalized swim Training Plans,"A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts. 

Thanks to the devs for their prompt and helpful support!",0.98661894
471,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I used to swim without a plan, which I see is a huge mistake. Swimming with MySwimPro is fun, stimulating, challenging, and I learn a lot from the training videos. I have other swimmers using it now at the Y. Highly recommend. I want to swim when I am 94 so please stay in business.",0.9866779
472,Personalized swim Training Plans,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.9881724
473,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting. 

I love myswimpro!!!",0.9843301

488,Personalized swim Training Plans,Great App. I synch it up with my Apple Watch and it delivers my workout set by set.

537,Personalized swim Training Plans,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.9843301
538,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.9843301
539,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9843301
540,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.9843301
541,Personalized swim Training Plans,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.17633541
542,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9843301
543,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9843301
544,Personalized swim Training Plans,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.9843301
545,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

Best swimming app on the market!!",0.9843301

Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.9843301
547,Personalized swim Training Plans,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.18985423
548,Personalized swim Training Plans,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance.

549,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming. I love that I can track my progress, pick from a variety of sets, and customize my workouts to my ability.  The videos are helpful, especially for those just getting into swimming.  The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.9868995

598,Personalized swim Training Plans,"This app finally got me back in the pool, after a ten-year hiatus. The workouts are interesting, go by quickly, and I’m so pleased to see real progress. When I was trying to swim without it, I was doing maybe 1000-1500k but I’m back at 3-4K workouts, like I did in high school. Just did my first dryland workout and I like the format of that, too! I recommend it to all the swimmers in my life :)",0.2082492
599,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I started swimming 4 years ago at the age of 50 and stumbled upon this app through the YouTube videos that taught me how to swim. For 2+ years I put off paying the “extra” money for the coaching and other features available. Now that I did purchase the coaching, I have ZERO regrets. My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.9843301

601,Personalized swim Training Plans,"It’s a great app! I wish the yearly cost would go down a bit but I like it. It’s really helped me improve my swimming and help make me stronger. One of my problems is that I don’t have a 6 digit code come up on my watch, though I don’t know if the problems from the app or my watch. If I could get an answer that would be nose. Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",0.9843301
602,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I have gone through all the updates and swim 5-6 times per week. Logging from Apple Watch 2 has stopped. The info goes into my activity and HeartWatch apps but logging is not happening on the MySwimPro app itself! Cmon man! The social feed stuff is cute, but at least get the log to work for our own history so we can repeat workouts we like or improve on total workout times, etc before you bog my stuff down with cutsie social media fodder. Going on 2year premium user but have no qualms about going back to a ziplock with a printed workout.

10-16-18 update. Logging seems to be fixed. Changed rating to 4 instead of 2 stars. I hope the main focus continues to be on the basic functionality working PERFECTLY in the midst of the desire to add more “neato” features.",0.17633541
603,Personalized swim Training Plans,"I've used this app 3 times and all 3 times I got inaccurate lap counts. Seems to be way off the count by 800-900 yards. I usually swim 3500 to 4000 yards and it will only count 2600-3100 .. that's a big difference. And yes I'm doing all the right things .. not stopping in middle of my
Laps, I make sure I have a good turn and push off. This morning I was finishing up a 3500 yard swim .. my lap count was 2600...

I don't particularly care to race, but I do want to swim faster, improve my techniques, and get the best swim workouts possible. This app helps me do just that. From the technique videos to guided workouts and monthly challenges, my swimpro has coached me to better swimming in a short time. Love this app! It's a totally worthwhile investment!",0.9843301
605,Personalized swim Training Plans,"While this app seems very progressive, easy to use and like a genuinely good option for learning swimmers, athletes, etc., it costs a lot just to get a training plan! It would be great if I can just learn new techniques and become a better swimmer without having to pay 9.99$ a month - which I can ALREADY learn how to be with my school's swim coach. I don't think it should cost this much for an extra boost.",0.9843301
606,Personalized swim Training Plans,"As a beginner swimmer who is working on my strokes and techniques, the app has been helpful in having everything I need in one place. The video demonstration and the workout plan in one place is really helpful for someone who either is new to swimming or is an advanced swimmer.

774,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.9931722
775,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.13502564
776,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.13502564
777,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.13502564
778,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9908421
779,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.9935505

The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.9672656

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning.

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.9908421

So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

860,"New, personalized Workout of the Day 365 days a year","I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.13502564

1161,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.37736633
1162,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.93289226
1163,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.93289226
1164,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.93289226
1165,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.36015552
1166,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.38040897

The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.68924445
1169,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning.

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.41981006
1174,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.93289226
1175,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.93289226
1176,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.36015552
1177,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved.

1178,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.37053666

I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",0.38995683

I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming.

I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.93289226

I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

1184,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.93289226

I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well.

Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train.

Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.",0.7550467

One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome).

1198,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

1232,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,0.38736647
1233,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",0.93935144
1234,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I usually don’t leave reviews but really wanted to support the guys building MySwimPro.

1235,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Fantastic app, total game changer. Gives new meaning to your swimming especially in conjunction with an Apple Watch. I bought one just for this reason. It is that good.

Can't wait to see where this is going in the future, in particular with respect to even more personalization and community!",0.43017027
1236,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,0.4689942
1237,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"This is a good app. I like it. But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well. At least I can connect my Fitbit to it and use the app into a train by session. You can log workouts and it’s very helpful! I only gave it four stars because there should be at least 2 free workouts.",0.936692
1238,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I wish there was an app like this for every exercise. Would be great for track running and interval type workouts. Even regular lifting to a schedule would be great with this type of app.

1239,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I was using the Apple Watch swim activity and that normally worked fine but I was doing lengths with little purpose.

1243,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals.

1244,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"A great and well made app!

1246,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.94103265
1247,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting.

1311,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.93289226
1312,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.93289226

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.93289226
1314,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

1316,Extensive Workout Library of stroke-specific workouts,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.93289226

I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.93289226

1548,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.30361432
1549,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.95825315
1550,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.95825315
1551,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.95825315
1552,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.28592122
1553,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.30674523

My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.63033044
1556,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.41766414

I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning.

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it.

1560,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.3473738

The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.95825315

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.95825315
1563,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.28592122

The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved. 

I recently had an issue with my account and the customer service was on point. I got an immediate response and my issue was resolved with that one response. Keep up the great work, MySwimPro!",0.95825315

Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.2965898

I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",0.3165761

Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming.

I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",0.99825513

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.95825315

I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.95825315

There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well.

One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome).

1585,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

1623,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep",I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,0.3983201

But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well.

1634,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

1699,"Customized intervals for each set, including target splits for every rep","I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike.

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.95825315

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.95825315

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

1935,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.518337

It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more.

1937,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.8646269
1938,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

1939,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.5024145
1940,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.5211458

To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it!

There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.55734986
1948,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.8646269
1949,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"UPDATE:

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.8646269
1950,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.5024145
1951,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved.

1952,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.51202554

I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",0.52994794

But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming.

Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",0.95665544
1956,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Live the app! The best part I enjoy are all the videos and how exercises are explained throughly. There are lots of exercises in workouts and videos to explain before activities, and you can change during workouts. 

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.8646269

I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim.

1958,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.8646269
1959,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"This isn’t really a critique it’s more me asking if a feature could be added. I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well. 

Thank you.",0.8646269
1960,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid. Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.,0.8646269
1961,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I began training and racing in triathlons last year. Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.",0.8487833

1969,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.8646269

1972,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.8646269
1973,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

It is the next best thing to having a live coach and their customer service is the best I have seen from any app developer. Definitely a smart investment for any level swimmer.,0.8704838
2003,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do. It also forces me to do the sets at the correct training paces. I highly recommend it for anyone unable to join a team.",0.9741277
2004,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.",0.51648384
2005,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.8646269
2006,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,0.5275618
2007,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",0.87371117

2010,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,0.60208195
2011,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"This is a good app. I like it. But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well. At least I can connect my Fitbit to it and use the app into a train by session. You can log workouts and it’s very helpful! I only gave it four stars because there should be at least 2 free workouts.",0.86995244
2012,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I wish there was an app like this for every exercise. Would be great for track running and interval type workouts. Even regular lifting to a schedule would be great with this type of app.

2013,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I was using the Apple Watch swim activity and that normally worked fine but I was doing lengths with little purpose.

2016,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Actually closer than 2nd ... this app gives serious swimmers so much, to complain about its kinks is  ungenerous.

2017,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals.

2018,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts.

2020,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.8761013
2021,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting.

2085,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.8646269
2086,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.8646269
2087,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.8646269
2088,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.5024145
2090,100% guided swim workouts on your Apple Watch,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.8646269

I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.8646269

2322,Build your own custom workouts,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.29678968
2323,Build your own custom workouts,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.9602743
2324,Build your own custom workouts,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.9602743
2325,Build your own custom workouts,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.9602743
2326,Build your own custom workouts,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.27905798
2327,Build your own custom workouts,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.29992768
2328,Build your own custom workouts,"High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

2329,Build your own custom workouts,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.62476
2330,Build your own custom workouts,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.41115278

BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.",0.29341337
2332,Build your own custom workouts,"It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! 

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master.

Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan .

2334,Build your own custom workouts,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.34065586

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!",0.9602743

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!

I use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.",0.9602743
2337,Build your own custom workouts,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.27905798

I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored.

So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

2390,Build your own custom workouts,"As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do. It also forces me to do the sets at the correct training paces. I highly recommend it for anyone unable to join a team.",0.9998782
2391,Build your own custom workouts,"When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.",0.29472098
2392,Build your own custom workouts,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.9602743
2393,Build your own custom workouts,I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?,0.30710706
2394,Build your own custom workouts,"The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars",0.965239

2397,Build your own custom workouts,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,0.3917474

But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well.

2407,Build your own custom workouts,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.96651715

I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

2473,Build your own custom workouts,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own.

It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike.

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9602743

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

2709,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.53704464
2710,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.85335267
2711,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.85335267
2712,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.85335267
2713,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.5213341
2714,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.5398151

The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.8078085

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!",0.6360117

I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning.

I grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.5213341

I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming.

I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.85335267

I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me.

However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.85335267

There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

2791,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data",Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼,0.86129606
2792,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts.

2794,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data",This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.8652711
2795,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.85335267
2860,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.85335267
2861,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.85335267
2862,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.5213341
2864,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.85335267

I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.85335267
2866,"Detailed analytics, including stroke, split and SWOLF data","So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.85335267

3096,Drill & technique video library,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.9904799
3097,Drill & technique video library,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.15597275
3098,Drill & technique video library,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.15597275
3099,Drill & technique video library,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.15597275
3100,Drill & technique video library,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9877614
3101,Drill & technique video library,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.99092716

The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

3103,Drill & technique video library,"I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.9724214
3104,Drill & technique video library,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning.

I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master.

3108,Drill & technique video library,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

3111,Drill & technique video library,"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.9877614

Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!",0.98943937
3114,Drill & technique video library,"While the app itself is amazing between the video demos, training options, workouts, and tracking available, the customer service is what has made me come and place this review. I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!",0.9922646
3115,Drill & technique video library,"This app is amazing and the customer service is awesome! I had been a swimmer growing up and always had access to a coach. But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming. I’ve lost more weight than I thought I could, I’m swimming faster now than when I was a kid and I feel like I’m apart of a community. This app really changed my life for the better.",0.31074265
3116,Drill & technique video library,"I really do like this app. I love that it gives analytics on distance per stroke. I wear an Apple
Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.",0.37787238
3117,Drill & technique video library,"Live the app! The best part I enjoy are all the videos and how exercises are explained throughly. There are lots of exercises in workouts and videos to explain before activities, and you can change during workouts. 

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",0.15597275
3118,Drill & technique video library,"I am in my late 50s, was a swimmer in HS and college and really came back to the sport because I needed low impact on my knees. I have loved this app for almost 3 yrs. 
I applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim. 
Go MSP Team!",0.15597275
3119,Drill & technique video library,"I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.",0.15597275
3120,Drill & technique video library,"This isn’t really a critique it’s more me asking if a feature could be added. I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well. 

Thank you.",0.15597275
3121,Drill & technique video library,Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid. Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.,0.15597275
3122,Drill & technique video library,"I began training and racing in triathlons last year. Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.",0.94582224
3123,Drill & technique video library,"When I first download the app they had an update, and none of the tutorials videos works. Upon contacting customer support they were more than helpful and provided working links to all the video within a timely manner. In addition, you can download all the swim workout as a pdf and print it out. However, It a bit of a bum but understandable that the garmin sync for easy workout transfer doesn’t work. However I was surprised they even offered the feature they also have it for Fitbit and Apple Watch.",0.15597275
3124,Drill & technique video library,I have been using My Swim Pro for about two months and I am truly amazed at the ability of the app to create bespoke training plans for me.   Time seems to fly by now in the pool.  My technique and fitness are very clearly improving and I am enjoying the global MSP community tremendously.   I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.  Thank you SO much My Swim Pro!,0.15597275
3125,Drill & technique video library,"I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. 

The latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. 

No matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!",0.16639374
3126,Drill & technique video library,"My sister and I have taken up swimming in our 40’s after many years of running injuries. We grew up in Florida so we could swim before we could walk but never swam on a team.  We initially joined a Adult Summer swim league and had a blast!! We wanted to continue through the fall and winter and build up our endurance, strength and work on technique. The app makes this so easy as it has the workouts already planned for us we just bring our phone to the pool in the waterproof case and voila.",0.9893277
3127,Drill & technique video library,"This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season.

Great product and great customer service, five stars.",0.15597275
3130,Drill & technique video library,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.15597275
3131,Drill & technique video library,"Not only is this the best fitness app I’ve used, it might be one of the best apps I’ve ever used period. I’ve gone from swimming with no plan or intent to doing structured workouts and have improved immensely in only a couple weeks. The Apple Watch app can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly. I love the short videos they provide on technique as well. Highly recommend if you’re serious about improving your swimming!",0.15597275
3132,Drill & technique video library,"I had just started swimming again after not swimming for years and had recently became a lifeguard (again). I wanted to swim faster than my coworkers but just general fitness in general, so I took it upon myself for one of their annual sales for a year. Did it.

All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",0.16603781
3133,Drill & technique video library,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.15597275
3134,Drill & technique video library,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

Again, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.",0.15597275
3135,Drill & technique video library,My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.  The Apps on iPhone and Apple Watch are both very well done and stable.  The paid subscription is well worth it.,0.9935955
3136,Drill & technique video library,I will say that this app finally got me back to swimming after 4 years of not being able to get back in the pool. I can’t get into a swim team because of reasons so I had the worst time in making workouts for me. This app is worth its money!

3178,Drill & technique video library,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼,0.1711969
3179,Drill & technique video library,"A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts.

I want to swim when I am 94 so please stay in business.",0.16963778
3181,Drill & technique video library,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.17895111
3182,Drill & technique video library,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting.

3245,Drill & technique video library,Off to a great start in pool and dry land. Love the app,0.9787454
3246,Drill & technique video library,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.15597275
3247,Drill & technique video library,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.15597275
3248,Drill & technique video library,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.15597275
3249,Drill & technique video library,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.15597275
3250,Drill & technique video library,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.9877614
3251,Drill & technique video library,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.15597275
3252,Drill & technique video library,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.15597275
3253,Drill & technique video library,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.15597275
3254,Drill & technique video library,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

3255,Drill & technique video library,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.15597275
3256,Drill & technique video library,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.98981273
3257,Drill & technique video library,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance.

3258,Drill & technique video library,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming.

The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.17098583
3259,Drill & technique video library,"But I do wish there was a place to put the desired workout time.

When I was trying to swim without it, I was doing maybe 1000-1500k but I’m back at 3-4K workouts, like I did in high school. Just did my first dryland workout and I like the format of that, too! I recommend it to all the swimmers in my life :)",0.99231076

For 2+ years I put off paying the “extra” money for the coaching and other features available. Now that I did purchase the coaching, I have ZERO regrets. My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",0.15597275

One of my problems is that I don’t have a 6 digit code come up on my watch, though I don’t know if the problems from the app or my watch. If I could get an answer that would be nose. Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",0.15597275

The info goes into my activity and HeartWatch apps but logging is not happening on the MySwimPro app itself! Cmon man! The social feed stuff is cute, but at least get the log to work for our own history so we can repeat workouts we like or improve on total workout times, etc before you bog my stuff down with cutsie social media fodder. Going on 2year premium user but have no qualms about going back to a ziplock with a printed workout.

10-16-18 update. Logging seems to be fixed. Changed rating to 4 instead of 2 stars. I hope the main focus continues to be on the basic functionality working PERFECTLY in the midst of the desire to add more “neato” features.",0.9877614

Laps, I make sure I have a good turn and push off. This morning I was finishing up a 3500 yard swim .. my lap count was 2600...

3483,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.5510982
3484,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.84450096
3485,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.84450096
3486,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.84450096
3487,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.53555405
3488,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.5538387

To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.",0.817568

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.

I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.5891166

The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

I have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.53555405

Time seems to fly by now in the pool.  My technique and fitness are very clearly improving and I am enjoying the global MSP community tremendously.   I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.  Thank you SO much My Swim Pro!,0.84450096
3512,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. 

The latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. 

No matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!",0.85010874
3513,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"My sister and I have taken up swimming in our 40’s after many years of running injuries. We grew up in Florida so we could swim before we could walk but never swam on a team.  We initially joined a Adult Summer swim league and had a blast!! We wanted to continue through the fall and winter and build up our endurance, strength and work on technique. The app makes this so easy as it has the workouts already planned for us we just bring our phone to the pool in the waterproof case and voila.",0.5442944
3514,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season. This app’s workout structure is varied, purposeful, and expertly crafted - couldn’t ask for better. Also, in general, one of the best UI/UX designs in a fitness app I’ve ever used. If you swim or previously swam competitively in high school/college, get this app.",0.5520037
3515,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"It took a bit to get this app dialed in on my Apple watch - but now that I’ve done that,  I’ll never be witout this app!!!  I love MySwimPro!

I’ve programmed in my workout, my watch vibrates (“swim now” prompt), I swim my 50m interval, touch the wall and wait for the next prompt.   No need to look at the watch…just wait for the next prompt and go (interval training).

I’m 65, heart attack and lung issues; but now I’m in the pool, regaining my health through swimming and MySwimpro is leading the way!  Thank you MySwimPro…you truly are a lifesaver.",0.53555405
3516,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Having some problems with the app recording my pool sets, I reached out to Myswimpro and Charlie Brown replied. We were able to set up a WebCam meeting where Charlie successfully diagnosed the problems, walked me through the fix and everything works now as it should. I highly recommend the app and Charlie was both professional, friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend this product and the company. Great product and great customer service, five stars.",0.84450096
3517,Compete in monthly swim challenges,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.,0.84450096
3518,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Not only is this the best fitness app I’ve used, it might be one of the best apps I’ve ever used period. I’ve gone from swimming with no plan or intent to doing structured workouts and have improved immensely in only a couple weeks. The Apple Watch app can be a little tricky to get the hang of at first but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly. I love the short videos they provide on technique as well. Highly recommend if you’re serious about improving your swimming!",0.84450096
3519,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I had just started swimming again after not swimming for years and had recently became a lifeguard (again). I wanted to swim faster than my coworkers but just general fitness in general, so I took it upon myself for one of their annual sales for a year. Did it. I even had problems with the dry land part of the app syncing to my watch, CS (customer support) was more than happy to help with everything. All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!",0.8499186
3520,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.84450096
3521,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

Again, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.",0.84450096
3522,Compete in monthly swim challenges,My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.  The Apps on iPhone and Apple Watch are both very well done and stable.  The paid subscription is well worth it.,0.5716688
3523,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I will say that this app finally got me back to swimming after 4 years of not being able to get back in the pool. I can’t get into a swim team because of reasons so I had the worst time in making workouts for me. This app is worth its money! The way it is structured helps me ADHD brain to finally commit on doing something. My overall life has just become better because if it. I can’t thank you guys enough!,0.84450096
3524,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"As a former competitive swimmer getting back in the pool after 30 years, the workouts have been perfect in helping me get back up to speed. While I’ve got a long way to go, I’m not floundering around at the pool swimming junk yardage and made up sets. I’m looking forward to getting into the intermediate and advanced workouts. Plus there are multiple workouts for free, back, breast, IM, kick and sprint - really nothing short of hiring a coach to watch you. Highly recommend!",0.84450096

3526,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"With Master Swim sessions at my pool suspended, My Swim Pro has been a great help at improving the quality and focus of my workouts in the pool.  

The daily workouts keep things fresh for me  and It’s great to have the option of tweaking them to fit my needs in the APP.  I also love how MSP tracks and records my entire workout -so cool!!!

When Master Swim sessions come back to my pool I can tell you that MY Swim Pro will be with me for every stroke and kick.",0.84450096
3527,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I really like the ability to write my own workouts with intervals and rest times.  The cool thing is it buzzes when I need to go on the next ‘rep’.  I’m also counting challenged and sometimes forget where I am in a 400 or 500 - a quick glance can confirm where I am on that rep.  I appreciate that I have the option to sign up for a monthly subscription but am not required to to use the basic functionality of the app.  Great development and execution!,0.84450096
3528,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I have really given this app a try for at least 3 months.  They fixed the issue of the Apple Watch not responding to the pressure to pause resume etc; but now 50% of the time the workout does not log;  although the workout appears  in the Health app of the iPhone, (and the data comes from the My Swim Pro) but it does not appear in the My Swim Pro app. I wish they could get it to work properly and consistently. Well $75 down the drain.",0.559429
3529,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I downloaded this app for my Fitbit verse two. When it was installed, I was trying to figure it out; when I set it all up, I chose a workout, then I went on my Fitbit, and then I tap load work out. It said,” connect to phone, error with the connection. ” but so far, I wouldn't grade this app for a lousy star rating. I think it needs to be connected to pads and iPhones. Even I am connected to the wifi; it does it too.",0.84450096
3530,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I was a seasonal competitive swimmer but during the off-season I didn’t have any coaching. This app helped me improve my swimming in the same way a coach would.

Thankfully, I got back in the water after a near 20 year hiatus. MySwimPro was a fundamentally significant part of my return not just to the pool and swimming, but even a bit of racing here and there. 5 medals in 5 races at my first Masters Nationals gave me the jolt to keep swimming and keep working.

3544,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I love this app! As a swimmer this app is super user friendly and simple.

3553,Compete in monthly swim challenges,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work.

But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well.

It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

3632,Compete in monthly swim challenges,Off to a great start in pool and dry land. Love the app,0.80061483
3633,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.84450096
3634,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.84450096
3635,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.84450096
3636,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.84450096
3637,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.53555405
3638,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.84450096
3639,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.84450096
3640,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.84450096
3641,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it's totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!",0.84450096
3642,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.84450096
3643,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.54711616
3644,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance. If you can eventually make it stay on the screen, there is no way to end and log your workout; the time keeps going and it says ""Ending workout..."" until you delete the app and reinstall it.",0.5493513
3645,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming. I love that I can track my progress, pick from a variety of sets, and customize my workouts to my ability.  The videos are helpful, especially for those just getting into swimming.  The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.8525529
3646,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"But I do wish there was a place to put the desired workout time. As in approximately 30 minutes, 60 minutes, etc. The ability to add/remove parts of the workout help with this, but still wish there was a button to hit so the app can give me a good workout for the amount of time I have.",0.8512339
3647,Compete in monthly swim challenges,I'm a lifeguard and at my job we are required to swim a lot. I  try to swim more so I can increase my strokes and to stay fit. This is a great app!

3649,Compete in monthly swim challenges,"I love this app! I use it if practice ever gets canceled. I'll write down the set, take it to the pool, and when I get back I log my swim!

My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps.

Going on 2year premium user but have no qualms about going back to a ziplock with a printed workout.

It would be great if I can just learn new techniques and become a better swimmer without having to pay 9.99$ a month - which I can ALREADY learn how to be with my school's swim coach.

3870,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.34765115
3871,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.94390005
3872,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.94390005
3873,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.94390005
3874,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.33023137
3875,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.35073194

The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50!

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.

3882,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. 

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

3885,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.33023137

With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.94390005
3908,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.

The app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

For the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.

3909,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.  The Apps on iPhone and Apple Watch are both very well done and stable.  The paid subscription is well worth it.,0.37084928
3910,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),I will say that this app finally got me back to swimming after 4 years of not being able to get back in the pool.

4020,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.94390005
4021,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.94390005
4022,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.94390005
4023,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.94390005
4024,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.33023137
4025,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.94390005
4026,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.94390005
4027,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.94390005
4028,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time.

Best swimming app on the market!!",0.94390005
4029,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.94390005

There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.3431797
4031,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance. If you can eventually make it stay on the screen, there is no way to end and log your workout; the time keeps going and it says ""Ending workout..."" until you delete the app and reinstall it.",0.3456887
4032,30-day money back guarantee (annual memberships only),"As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming.

The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.948816

Going on 2year premium user but have no qualms about going back to a ziplock with a printed workout.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts!

But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.9695369

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure.

And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.24494523

My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

4294,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.9695369

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

4408,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.9695369

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.9695369

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

4412,Use MySwimPro FREE to:,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.9695369

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.9695369

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.12210334

You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.994608

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure.

And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.

My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike.

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.994608

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

5033,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.99593973
5034,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.09002261

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.09002261

5181,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.99593973
5182,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.99593973
5183,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.99593973
5184,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

5186,Track & log your swims with or without a smartwatch,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.99593973

I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.99593973

5418,Track total distance swum,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.93808925

It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

5420,Track total distance swum,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.36370316
5421,Track total distance swum,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.36370316
5422,Track total distance swum,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9315149
5423,Track total distance swum,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.9315149

The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it does not keep track of my lap times very well which in turn messes up the swolf score, my best times and lap splits, etc. That being said, I have tried the available swim apps and this is still the best swim app out there!",0.38389263

5488,Track total distance swum,Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks,0.36370316

5493,Track total distance swum,I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch,0.96828514

5500,Track total distance swum,Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼,0.3780346
5501,Track total distance swum,"A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts.

5503,Track total distance swum,This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.,0.38531423
5504,Track total distance swum,"I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. 

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). 

Perfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting.

Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.36370316
5570,Track total distance swum,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.36370316
5571,Track total distance swum,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.36370316
5572,Track total distance swum,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.9315149
5573,Track total distance swum,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.36370316
5574,Track total distance swum,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.36370316
5575,Track total distance swum,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.36370316
5576,Track total distance swum,"I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it's totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!",0.36370316
5577,Track total distance swum,"The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I've concluded that you can't find a better app to log swims. I've recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I'm not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app's creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.
Overall, I highly recommend this app.",0.36370316
5578,Track total distance swum,"Our entire family uses this app whenever we can't swim with our team. There's something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It's easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it'll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It's intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!",0.9364281
5579,Track total distance swum,"In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance.

The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!",0.37783626

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.95305455

It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",0.32039264
5807,View logged workouts on your profile,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.32039264
5808,View logged workouts on your profile,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.",0.32039264
5809,View logged workouts on your profile,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9472848
5810,View logged workouts on your profile,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",0.9540449

To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch!

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.

I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",0.96604395

My only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

App developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.9472848

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.72007763

It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more.

6194,Earn achievement badges,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.70710677

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

6196,Earn achievement badges,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.70710677
6197,Earn achievement badges,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. 

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year.

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).",0.70710677

I also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500).

There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year.

6343,Earn achievement badges,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own.

It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike.

The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.70710677

I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",0.9721492

It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

6581,Follow friends,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",0.25232208

Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

6583,Follow friends,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",0.9676433

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year.

6613,Follow friends,So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts.

6616,Follow friends,"As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

Then there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.",0.25232208

Occasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.

The app doesn’t accurately record lap times.

I have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.

6729,Follow friends,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,0.25232208
6730,Follow friends,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",0.25232208
6731,Follow friends,"Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn't see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I'd normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

MySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.",0.25232208
6732,Follow friends,"I've tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I'm still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. 
I've recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.",0.25232208
6733,Follow friends,"LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you'll like it 😬",0.9676433
6734,Follow friends,"Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple's Activity app, but I don't really count that.)",0.25232208
6735,Follow friends,"I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the ""new"" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very ""pull"" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.",0.25232208
6736,Follow friends,"So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They're real deal workouts.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",0.25232208
