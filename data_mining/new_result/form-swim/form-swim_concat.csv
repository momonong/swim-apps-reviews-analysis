0,"The app is fine. Billing is weird. Form tried to bill me using Google Pay, which is fine. BUT the name was a person not ""FORM,"" so I suspected fraud and stopped the transaction thru my credit card. Once I verified that it was FORM, i have been in anightmare secnario with goole pay and Form. There is no way to renew the subscription once it expires. No tabs or buttons or icons in Google pay or the form app to re-subscribe so I can get workouts. Looking forward to hearing a solution so I don't have to switch to another product.",3,1,2.0.5,2021-10-02 07:00:19,2.0.5,GooglePlayStore,
1,"This is a great product and app. As someone who still wants to swim daily but doesn't have time for a team, this is the next best thing to having a coach standing next to you in the pool (just without all the yelling). I'm amazed with the goggles motion awareness and accuracy (my watches will often +/- a leangth randomly). My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!",5,5,2.2.2,2022-01-06 06:52:12,2.2.2,GooglePlayStore,
2,Really great app and goggles. I wish it could time out the display until I get close to a turn so I don't have to always see the numbers when zen and speeding through the water! UPDATED: Thank you for the reply. Leaving the question because it shows how easy this was to do once I found this customization area and how awesome this makes the device! Thank you for making a great product!!!,5,2,1.4.0,2020-01-29 14:09:52,1.4.0,GooglePlayStore,
3,"In general, it works well. Keeps track of workout and is easy to read. My one gripe is the way the workout builder is set up. You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",4,0,2.12.1,2023-04-27 13:23:23,2.12.1,GooglePlayStore,
4,"I originally purchased a pair 12/2019. Despite some early issues the goggles performed flawlessly afterwards. They are a major motivator to swim regularly and stimulate me to better my times. While competitive swimmers are probably all familiar with Form's goggles, I highly recommend them for casual swimmers like me who, at 60, is staying healthy by taking swimming up again after 45 years. Fantastic service, great product.",5,2,2.12.1,2023-04-19 20:23:27,2.12.1,GooglePlayStore,
5,Nice clean ans simple app interface. So far I had 4 sessions and I love it. It is very helpful to see running clock vs specific metrics in goggles. Would be nice to have ability to change metrics in the pool. So far I learned how to set metrics on the phone and synch before a pool session.,4,0,1.4.0,2020-01-30 09:43:08,1.4.0,GooglePlayStore,
6,"The goggles have given me more focus and direction to work on specific elements of training. Real-time feedback on times and heart rates (with polar OH1+ sensor on goggle strap) is great. The ability to easily build your own sessions in the app and transfer them to the goggles is fantastic, and the process is surprisingly straightforward. Definitely a fan!",5,0,3.3.0,2023-12-05 21:38:05,3.3.0,GooglePlayStore,
7,"Update: The so continues to improve. The import from TP is excellent. Upgrading to 5* Suggestion: Link up with Magic 5 and get them to produce compatible eye cups/seals. Would be awesome. So far so good. Used the goggles and app for a week. It's been very good. Will come back and give an update after I have used it longer. Could be improved if workouts were CSS based, but I guess I'll get over that small issue.",5,0,3.1.0,2023-10-29 03:00:00,3.1.0,GooglePlayStore,
8,FORM smart goggles are the coolest thing I've bought for a long time! I rediscovered my interest in swimming with them. The app is also amazing although I don't think it has much value without the goggles.,5,0,3.3.1,2023-12-11 20:21:30,3.3.1,GooglePlayStore,
9,"The app just works, syncing the swim from my goggles and uploading to Strava seamlessly. I couldn't ask for more. Update: They removed the ""premium membership expired"" messages from the goggle firmware in their latest update, so I'm reinstating a 5-star review for listening to user feedback.",5,0,3.0.1,2023-09-23 08:12:26,3.0.1,GooglePlayStore,

14,Still figuring it out the app. Love that I can see my time and laps real time visually my goggles instead of having to stop to see it on a wrist device.,4,0,3.2.3,2023-11-13 03:58:08,3.2.3,GooglePlayStore,

16,"I've had to knock some points off unfortunately. In general, the app is good and the Strava integration is great, but I have to reboot my phone (Pixel 3, Android 11) every single time to sync, which is a pain. Also, it constantly misregisters my strokes as 'mixed' rather than crawl – also a pain. There's still no way to see the current clock time in any of the dashboards (actual time, not minutes swam), which would be really useful for swimmers fitting in a session before work or in a lunch break.",3,2,2.0.4,2021-09-07 23:23:49,2.0.4,GooglePlayStore,
17,"Everything is working fine. The goggles are really good and the App is also very straightforward and easy to use. One feature that would be great to see is to have the option to sync your own structured workouts from other platforms like TrainingPeaks, and do them on the goggles! I'm sure that would be a feature many swimmers and Triathletes would love to see since many Athletes follow a personalised Plan. Thank you for the great Product. I'm Looking forward to seeing more features.",5,0,2.1.2,2021-11-27 05:25:40,2.1.2,GooglePlayStore,
18,"I love the goggles and the app! Spectacular! But why does the app need an internet connection to refresh the results? It should be done locally via Bluetooth. (In the same context, I didn't appreciate receiving a marketing email saying ""now that you've used the goggles a couple of times""... How do you know that? Who else has access to my data and where did I consent to that?) Could we also expect some further integrations in the future? (e.g. Google Fit?)",4,2,1.7.2,2020-11-26 20:55:52,1.7.2,GooglePlayStore,
19,"The FORM app and goggles itself are of superb quality and I'm a very happy triathlete because of it. They have been fundamental to my training Why two stars then? While, that's all because I feel FORM is changing the rules of the game while we are playing. They have introduced guided workouts (great!) but decided to put it behind a subscription. I disagree with this decision but even worse - the price is completely ridiculous. 19 EUR by month? Really? I seriously thought this was a mistake..",2,3,1.10.0,2021-08-25 06:16:01,1.10.0,GooglePlayStore,

21,"Amazing goggles and app, definitely helped me improve my swim times by a lot. Also, since they are kinda pricey (well worth) they are expensive enough to be an extra incentive to swim, cause besides swimming these goggles wont be used anywhere else! Def try em out if you like to swim and want to improve your timing!",5,0,1.3.0,2019-12-05 12:41:54,1.3.0,GooglePlayStore,
22,"Generally good and clear but I frequently have to restart my android phone to synch, and now I'm not able to watch the video tutorials anymore which is a big problem (no idea why, it just says ""we can't open this file type"").

25,"Game changer!!! This is amazing! As a lifelong competitive swimmer I wish I had found this 20 years ago. It gives your pace per lap, you have a pace clock in your vision. It is easy to operate, easy to see and the actual goggle itself is watertight and comfortable. I absolutely love it!",5,2,1.10.0,2021-07-14 19:26:27,1.10.0,GooglePlayStore,

27,"I rated a 5. However, the ""swim screen"" should really have a stopwatch counter that resets each turn (even for 25m).

28,Not very good. The unit buttons were defective and so I couldn't save my first swim with it. Returned it and waiting for a refund. Quality control is essential for a device like this. Lacking here. Really disappointed.,1,3,1.0.1,2019-09-04 10:54:25,1.0.1,GooglePlayStore,
29,Loving these goggles. I use them for both open water and training with my club. If using for open water I suggest pairing with a garmin watch to get more tracking details but the pool information logged and tracked is amazing. It pushes me harder and keeps my stroke count and pace consistent when I need it.,5,1,2.5.3,2022-06-24 02:03:58,2.5.3,GooglePlayStore,

33,"$200 lap counter. After 5 sessions in a 25m pool, I realize these googles are almost worthless. First and foremost: they do NOT ACCURATELY COUNT FREESTYLE STROKES. I mean way way off. I typically hit 16-17 strokes per length, these things will count towards of 40. So much for your SWOLF score. Also, you cannot add more than 150m of drills if you have a 25m pool selected.

157,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!",5,,,2020-08-04 11:07:47,,AppStore,Amazing! Now even better 😃
158,"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",5,,,2021-08-02 17:08:07,,AppStore,Very motivating
159,"This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don’t know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!",5,,,2020-11-25 14:41:27,,AppStore,I love these goggles
160,"The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don’t have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There’s no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don’t take the proper steps of progression then I don’t get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",3,,,2022-08-31 15:57:28,,AppStore,"It’s fine, but not revolutionary"

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that.

I’ve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light.

My one wish would be if it worked with Garmin Fenix 5X and the triHRM Heart belt. I use my Garmin watch all the time and when synced I have two swimming data that comes one from Form and the other from Garmin. :-( Strava doesn’t connect these two data either so it is a bit manual process to combine these two separately. 

The battery lasts long, cleaning and maintenance is easy. I think you only loose 25% of your vision not 50% as some mentioned because the data is transparent. 

I recommend every swimmer enthusiast these goggles.",4,,,2023-12-14 15:56:45,,AppStore,Googles of the Century

UPDATE:
Response from Form: “Unfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.”

My Response:
First, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I’m sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin’s limitation? 

BTW, I’ve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.",3,,,2022-05-04 10:24:55,,AppStore,Doesn’t Push Data to Garmin Connect
169,I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.

171,If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate.

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

See below the email I received from FORM.

If you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26.

2. HR displayed after pausing workout is wrong, both in FORM app and goggles. Heart rate shown is 20 BPM above actual rate and when examine using the FORM app the entire second half of the swim has HR increased by 20 BPM compared to first half.

In short totally unreliable data.

Furthermore this kind of errors are obvious software bugs and reveals that the goggles have not been tested properly when used for OW swims.

186,There is no app support. Multiple attempts at contact have gone unanswered for weeks. No ability to create your own workout and download to goggles.

216,"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM’s only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ….FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",2,,,2021-09-30 00:45:51,,AppStore,Does not sync to Apple Health
217,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you’ll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣",5,,,2020-11-13 12:30:30,,AppStore,Great Training Tech
