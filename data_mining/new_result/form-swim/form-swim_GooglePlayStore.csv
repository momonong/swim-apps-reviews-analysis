I wish it could time out the display until I get close to a turn so I don't have to always see the numbers when zen and speeding through the water! UPDATED: Thank you for the reply.

Keeps track of workout and is easy to read. My one gripe is the way the workout builder is set up. You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",4,0,2.12.1,2023-04-27 13:23:23,"Thanks for your review!
