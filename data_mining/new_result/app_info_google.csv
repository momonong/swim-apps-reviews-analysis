Billing is weird. Form tried to bill me using Google Pay, which is fine. BUT the name was a person not ""FORM,"" so I suspected fraud and stopped the transaction thru my credit card. Once I verified that it was FORM, i have been in anightmare secnario with goole pay and Form. There is no way to renew the subscription once it expires. No tabs or buttons or icons in Google pay or the form app to re-subscribe so I can get workouts. Looking forward to hearing a solution so I don\'t have to switch to another product.', ""This is a great product and app. As someone who still wants to swim daily but doesn't have time for a team, this is the next best thing to having a coach standing next to you in the pool (just without all the yelling). I'm amazed with the goggles motion awareness and accuracy (my watches will often +/- a leangth randomly). My only suggestion would be to have personalized workout programs available much like other swimming apps. Looking forward to the next (slimmer) version of the goggles!"", ""Really great app and goggles. I wish it could time out the display until I get close to a turn so I don't have to always see the numbers when zen and speeding through the water! UPDATED: Thank you for the reply. Leaving the question because it shows how easy this was to do once I found this customization area and how awesome this makes the device! Thank you for making a great product!!!"", ""In general, it works well. Keeps track of workout and is easy to read. My one gripe is the way the workout builder is set up. You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m."", ""I originally purchased a pair 12/2019. Despite some early issues the goggles performed flawlessly afterwards. They are a major motivator to swim regularly and stimulate me to better my times. While competitive swimmers are probably all familiar with Form's goggles, I highly recommend them for casual swimmers like me who, at 60, is staying healthy by taking swimming up again after 45 years. Fantastic service, great product."", 'Nice clean ans simple app interface. So far I had 4 sessions and I love it. It is very helpful to see running clock vs specific metrics in goggles. Would be nice to have ability to change metrics in the pool. So far I learned how to set metrics on the phone and synch before a pool session.', 'The goggles have given me more focus and direction to work on specific elements of training. Real-time feedback on times and heart rates (with polar OH1+ sensor on goggle strap) is great. The ability to easily build your own sessions in the app and transfer them to the goggles is fantastic, and the process is surprisingly straightforward. Definitely a fan!', ""FORM smart goggles are the coolest thing I've bought for a long time! I rediscovered my interest in swimming with them. The app is also amazing although I don't think it has much value without the goggles."", ""Update: The so continues to improve. The import from TP is excellent. Upgrading to 5* Suggestion: Link up with Magic 5 and get them to produce compatible eye cups/seals. Would be awesome. So far so good. Used the goggles and app for a week. It's been very good. Will come back and give an update after I have used it longer. Could be improved if workouts were CSS based, but I guess I'll get over that small issue."", 'The app just works, syncing the swim from my goggles and uploading to Strava seamlessly. I couldn\'t ask for more. Update: They removed the ""premium membership expired"" messages from the goggle firmware in their latest update, so I\'m reinstating a 5-star review for listening to user feedback.', 'Great tech - like what we are used to running and biking, but now - brought to swimming.', ""The most recent update doesn't allow me to view lap times within intervals. I can only view the total time for the interval or lap time for every single lap, not traced to intervals."", ""I've had to knock some points off unfortunately. In general, the app is good and the Strava integration is great, but I have to reboot my phone (Pixel 3, Android 11) every single time to sync, which is a pain. Also, it constantly misregisters my strokes as 'mixed' rather than crawl – also a pain. There's still no way to see the current clock time in any of the dashboards (actual time, not minutes swam), which would be really useful for swimmers fitting in a session before work or in a lunch break."", ""Everything is working fine. The goggles are really good and the App is also very straightforward and easy to use. One feature that would be great to see is to have the option to sync your own structured workouts from other platforms like TrainingPeaks, and do them on the goggles! I'm sure that would be a feature many swimmers and Triathletes would love to see since many Athletes follow a personalised Plan. Thank you for the great Product. I'm Looking forward to seeing more features."", 'I love the goggles and the app! Spectacular! But why does the app need an internet connection to refresh the results? It should be done locally via Bluetooth. (In the same context, I didn\'t appreciate receiving a marketing email saying ""now that you\'ve used the goggles a couple of times""... How do you know that? Who else has access to my data and where did I consent to that?) Could we also expect some further integrations in the future? (e.g. Google Fit?)', ""The FORM app and goggles itself are of superb quality and I'm a very happy triathlete because of it. They have been fundamental to my training Why two stars then? While, that's all because I feel FORM is changing the rules of the game while we are playing. They have introduced guided workouts (great!) but decided to put it behind a subscription. I disagree with this decision but even worse - the price is completely ridiculous. 19 EUR by month? Really? I seriously thought this was a mistake.."", 'Best swim goggles ever. If you want to understand your swim technique and how to improve it, these goggles are unbeatable.', 'The app is great. I love the assisted workout option.', 'Still figuring it out the app. Love that I can see my time and laps real time visually my goggles instead of having to stop to see it on a wrist device.', 'when I open videos on the coaching tab the app crashes:( Ive restarted my phone, cleared cache and uninstalled/reinstalled the app without success']",com.formathletica.formandroid,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.formathletica.formandroid&hl=en&gl=us

I don't particularly care to race, but I do want to swim faster, improve my techniques, and get the best swim workouts possible. This app helps me do just that. From the technique videos to guided workouts and monthly challenges, my swimpro has coached me to better swimming in a short time. Love this app! It's a totally worthwhile investment!"", 'If you never swam competitively ever, or dont want the hassle of doing a quick google search, then this app is okay. However, as a past swimmer and current coach, the sets are somewhat stale, and the majority of them are behind what i would consider to be a decently high paywall. i get the desire to charge for this, but it shouldbt be nearly so expensive, and you shouls feel like you are getting a lot more for your money. The only nice thing i see is that they are color coded', ""While this app seems very progressive, easy to use and like a genuinely good option for learning swimmers, athletes, etc., it costs a lot just to get a training plan! It would be great if I can just learn new techniques and become a better swimmer without having to pay 9.99$ a month - which I can ALREADY learn how to be with my school's swim coach. I don't think it should cost this much for an extra boost."", ""Update: moving down to one star as I've contacted support and received no answer. App seems good, but is very buggy...good workouts, but interface is often crashing or lagging, wont log workout plans, etc. Paid for the Premium subscription and now it wont give me access to premium features...and appears to have deleted a week of data. I'm sure Ill have a heck of a time getting any refund! Needed improvement to keep my business...now Im going to an alternate app."", 'As a beginner swimmer who is working on my strokes and techniques, the app has been helpful in having everything I need in one place. The video demonstration and the workout plan in one place is really helpful for someone who either is new to swimming or is an advanced swimmer. The monthly challenges inside the app also keeps it fun to stay active and hold oneself accountable for it. Adding the dryland training has been very helpful as well.', ""Easy to use, you can pick and choose from available workouts or make your own. Syncs to my Garmin watch so I don't need a pace clock, and can workout without the hassle! After a week of use, it randomly stopped working on my Garmin Fenix 5X. Charlie from MySwimPro's tech support spent the better part of the last few days working to resolve the issue with me. Already loved the app, but the effort put in to fix the issue was outstanding. Great app and an even better team behind it!"", 'Love this app! I started using this app on the free model! I created my own custom workouts each day and then loaded them onto my watch! I eventually decided to try the 7 day free trial to use all of the features and I wish I had done it sooner! The workout of the day is what I normally do and I love being able to track my split times and see my improvement over time! Customer support has been super helpful with getting me set up on my subscription( -had some issues with the play store)', ""Swim workouts seem legit, however no real guidance to do the test workouts to get the dynamic pacing in place. Analysis is extra, 50, 100 or 150 bucks... But no explanation what that entails. No coach profiles to see what their credentials are. The Garmin IQ app integration is worthless, doesn't work at all. After some research this is an ongoing issue for over a year. App is a good concept. Just not refined enough for 119 a year. There are free alternatives that work flawlessly."", ""I was enthusiastic about this app but... I'm very glad that I didn't pay for whole year. App for WearOS is useless. There is literally no sync with mobile app. Some content is repeating itself without clear explanation what you have to do. Some content doesn't even open and videos do not play. Out of the water exercises are ok but app freeze when you try to end or save it. If you took beginners training,l you still have to know every single swimming phrase. Awful app for that price. Poor quality"", ""The watch app does not work with Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. I've requested for support from Dev team but got very poor response. Seems like Android is not their priority and they don't even enable Location permission on the watch. While the online tutorials are great, I just cannot use the training program on the watch as it does not record laps taken. Adequate Screenshots have already been shared with the team."", ""The only reason I can't give 5 stars it's because the Apple version still looks bether than the Android one, but I hope this change in the future. I hed some issues with the app in the beginning due to some bugs in the Android version, but they were promptly and quickly solved after I've reported the issues to the support team, which was great in quicly leting me know that the issues was fixed. This was a good demonstration of how much they value their customers, I'm very happy with that."", 'Black screen for training videos. Clearly still not working, despite this being stated in a previous review that it was fixed. The app was patched on 27th Jan. Please could you provide an update. Edit: despite being assured it is fixed, it is not. The rating stands and honestly it is very frustrating.', 'I love this app and it keeps evolving to improve the experience. Their support is also quick. Their plans do as intended and I am constantly impressed by my ability to learn new techniques with the guidance and videos given to compliment the workouts.a1l', 'This app is gold! With plenty of workouts to make your swimming experience enjoyable and progressive! Videos are clear and brief, and the appearance is nice as well.', ""The app is good but using an android, it has glitches that aren't on Apple. When I save a practice, it will change what I save in two or more sets to still equal the same yardage, but different. Like I have 2*500 all out and 600 warm down, it saves 2*600 and 400 warm down."", 'Not for Wear OS users. Bought a Samsung Watch 4 relying on their announcement of support for Wear OS watches. But too many bugs and errors that crop up when doing just routine stuff that any swimmer would do makes me regret the purchase. Sent them feedback with all the issues encountered, still waiting for the promised watch app update.', 'It is a useful app, and it makes it easier to coach myself while in the pool. The exercise videos help explain how to a drill or a certain technique. I highly recommend it for swimmers who work full time.', ""For some reason it is impossible to deselect freestyle when asked what styles you can swim 100m. That's the style I struggle with because of form, breast and back I can do but freestyle I wanted to deselect... Impossible"", ""Absolutely useless..app is only for swimmers who already know all the lingo and the layout of the workouts..like a foreign language.. nothing broken down or simplified for the beginner.. and the 'helpful' videos don't even play.. wouldn't even be worth it if it was free"", 'Absolutely exorbitant fees.

While it did work multiple times, when I used it to record my most important swim of the year (a 5.2km open water swim) on Galaxy watch 5, it failed to sync/upload the data. The data is there with an upload button, but it gives ""upload unsuccessful"" every time. I contacted support, but they were totally unhelpful: their recommendation was to manually enter total time/distance (and accept losing all pace & heart rate data).', ""I have used this app to record swims, manually, through my USMS FLOG, and from my Swim2 watch through Garmin Connect. Mostly this was seamless, but when it wasn't the support team was a big help. The support team is super. They are responsive and listen to suggestions well. This is the only app that I know of, where I can fix the mistakes that I made using my watch in the pool. I can also adjust when the watch reads my stroke wrong. This is the go to app for looking at what I actually did."", ""I'd give this a 4.5 if I could. It's not a perfect app, there are some things that could be changed (a more direct way to get to your active challenges, for one). However, it works well with pretty much any fitness tracker out there, syncs nicely with Garmin/Strava. The monthly challenges are very motivating. Making the progress bar for the challenges a bit more prominent would be a nice change, too. All in all, though, this is a great app for us swimmers."", ""I would love it if it was accurate. I am not sure if the problems come from my swimming style, the software, or the hardware (using a Fossil Carlyle). In addition, I would love to have the following features: - the ability to manually edit/delete swimming logs (to help correct accuracy) - clear documentation on how to connect to Google Fit ( I see the option within account settings but haven't figured out how to use it) - ability to pause workouts (improve UX to make it easily discoverable)"", ""Syncing with a watch is a horrible experience. The login page does not come up every time on my phone. I've tried opening the Swim app on my phone and the WearOS app. But could only get the login screen to come up once. Then once it came up, found it the login screen doesn't include integration with my Google account. Had to delete my account and use a regular email account. Now I can't get the login screen to come back up."", ""It's simply has too many issues, the watch app freezes and is a massive battery drain, the phone app freezes, and the website doesn't aggregate and average the daily, weekly and yearly distances. You have no idea what I have to go through to get the swims logged. I wish I was better at Excel and I would write a program myself."", ""I have a Samsung Galaxy Watch 46mm. currently I'm swimming in a 38ft private pool. I swim laps for a mi several days a week. I don't do swimmers turns. the yardage measuremeant is way off. it might be my fault as I don't do a snap turn but touch the wall turn and take off instead of maybe pausing and starting back up. I would like to see this app allow for brief break each lap, to let water out of goggles, take a couple breaths, etc. example swam looked at watch it said 100yds swam more still 100"", ""Doesn't record all your swims even though the same swims are documented on other apps. I just swam yesterday and it didn't log on this app, but logged to Garmin and Strava just fine as usual. Talked to support and got a weak response that basically made it seem like the reason it didn't record my swim was because I was trying to record something other than a swim. Nice. No..... your app just doesn't work as good as it should. Deleting."", ""Got Issues This app worked great for over a year on two different Samsung watches. The last month however it has failed miserably. No as I am trying to finish my swim the app stops working and fails to remember my swim. The last 4 to 5 swims nothing. I go to history and it is gone. Please help love the app but doesn't work anymore. (Samsung Active 2)"", ""Overly obsessed with what pool you are in. It interferes with basic functionality. Also doesn't sync with Google fit, just allows you to export data that can be imported. Waste of time and effort."", ""Inaccuracy is really an issue, especially when I don't see any logical reasoning. Out of 4 routine swims, three were not right in distance, none of the four were correct in identifying strokes nor the change in laps. Also, syncing with Google Fit is useless. 2 heart points after a 1km swim without being able to edit is just wrong! Your app also thinks I rest half of my swim time. Time for the team to invest in app accuracy and take a break from making up workouts!"", ""I can NOT recommend this app (for watches) & customer service/help desk I have had tried to connect my watch and it won't. I contacted the help desk -who seemed to be very helpful initially, however it has been over a month and I have not heard back (I have sent 2 follow up emails) it appears they have just put it in the 'too hard' basket. Very disappointed. If you want to track your swims I can HIGHLY recommend form swimwear, they have EXCELLENT customer service and I have had zero issues."", ""I have and use both a Garmin and Suunto sports watches (and Strava), and my swim data transfer seamlessly to this app. The app gives nice and clear visual display of your swim statistics, and is very easy and intuitive to use. However, I should perhaps point out that I'm only a recreational swimmer, so my needs are definitely satisfied way sooner than some pro's."", 'Having tested for a couple of weeks, here are my impressions: 1.) Much better detection than S health with the galaxy watch. 2.) Freestyle, fly and backstroke are detected accurately, but breaststroke is not captured at all in my case, whereas it is with S health. 3.) I am finding myself having to re-athorize synchronization to Google fit after every swim or it is not synced. 4.) Ideally implementing synchronization to S health would be great to avoid using Health Sync.', ""For samsung wearable devices, this is the most accurate swimming app I have come across. Much better compared to speedo on and Samsung health. Works awesome with the galaxy watch. Only downside I have is that for some reason, once you launch the app it turns the watch brightness to max. Wish it didnt but It's not much of a big deal. On the gear 2pro, the display could use some tweaking though. You can't scroll through pages once water lock is on; it does not scroll automatically either. All in all, It's a great app and would highly recommend it."", 'The app is OK to use, but it has horrible support for units. There are several options to change the units from miles to meters. But so far I found not a single screen where the units are actually correct like I set them. I have it set to meters, and everywhere you can see ""y"" (probably ""yards"") where it should say ""m"". This is the same for the app and the smartwatch interface. Very annoying if you live in a country where they don\'t use retarded units. Contacting their support didn\'t help.', ""All in all the app is great app with potential to be even better. The problem is the tracking accuracy! It never gets the tracks right. Whenever I go for 100yards, it thinks it was only 75 and my results look bad. When I correct it in the app, I find that one of the returns was usually not tracked. When I split the track to the correct number my results are not updated to the leadership board. I wonder how many users have that problem too and thus don't even make it into the leadership board?"", ""I liked the app when I was just tracking my swims but when I started wanting to use the workouts I got incredibly frustrated. All of the workouts are in yards even though I specifically have it set to meters, ok fine I thought, I can just create my own workouts... Well technically yes, but if you don't swim it immediately well then it disappears. There is no way to save it, other than send yourself a PDF of it but I DO NOT WANT A PDF! If I wanted a PDF I would have just typed the damn thing!"", 'Edit: 23 Nov Upgraded to a Samsung Active 2 and the latest app version consistently freezes when trying to end a swim, loosing the entire record in the process, only syncs 2 swims ... Samsung Health automatically tracks all swims ... Latest version update of the app does not install on Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro, after old version worked more or less fine for months. Very little information on potential trouble shooting and no fallback solution, e.g. option to download/install previous version.', ""I can't pretend to understand all the graphs and charts..I will try...but the app.is a great motivator The only small grumble is you can't upload a workout straight to your Garmin but I get around by doing that manually""]",com.spiraledge.swimapp,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spiraledge.swimapp&hl=en&gl=us

I tried out the first 2 recommended workouts and liked them a lot, but now it won't generate any more and I don't have a subscription. Are there only 2 accessible workouts per mode without a subscription? Also some of the drill descriptions are hard to understand (in English). Not a huge problem but I'm not familiar with all the drills. (Edit: the videos are really helpful though!)"", ""SwimUp is a game-changer for swimmers! With customizable workouts, extensive drill libraries, and analytics, it's the ultimate companion for anyone looking to enhance their swimming experience. Highly recommended for swimmers of all levels!"", 'The SwimUp app has helped me going to the pool regularly. Their personalized training plan is just right for me. Not too easy, not too hard so no need to look through endless lists of workout plans to find the right one.', ""Personnal plan seems good at first glance but when I ask for 800m workout, it always give me training longer than 1k, up to 1.8km. Most of the workout in the personal plan seems to be a rearrangement of the existing training plans. Exporting to the Garmin watch is working but you have to use the Garmin app, it's a 2 steps process every time, no direct connection with the watch. (Edited, 800m issue was fixed)"", ""A lot of potential and probably the best of the kind in many aspects, including usability. But it is very limited and it seems development is completely stagnant. No option to remove workouts, restart program, increase workout duration/length or chose which equipment you have. Also doesn't export/import from Garmin or Polar. Very disappointed. It would have so much potential if it wasn't abandoned..."", 'The app is decent, I am using it, but the behavior in regards to sales is terrible, I have bought an yearly subscription at a very markdown price. Normally this should have locked in my subscription, instead I was refunded the money and forced to pay again because of new pricing. Buying a subscription means that it should be respected, if it was sold at a low price to gain customers, it means you made a conscious choice to loose money on initial marketing and leads.', ""An excellent app. I've been following Swimup on YouTube since it was first created. Pin point error correction, solutions and excelent effective training ideas on adult swimming. Program includes all basic and all advance levels and END and SPRT modes with using tools where necessary. I made my subscription on 2021 August 1st. I took many private lessons and group work so far, but I have never had such a rapid and effective development until now. You must try, time is valuable."", ""If only they got rid of those generic photos of that male swimmer from the start screen. And add some HD photos of Olympians, familiar faces for each category. This app would look immensely cleaner! Performance wise : the app won't save your work if you take a call or switch tabs from another app during your workout for some reason."", 'Would rate five stars if we had the option to select what equipment is available to us and tailor the workouts around that. Ex: not swimming in a pool so unable to do exercises based on pushing off the wall, etc. Also would like to be able to select less than 250m and less than 20 min on the set up questionnaire for complete beginners.', ""Subscription schemes to bleed customers dry ad infinitum are the only option offered to obtain the software's full functionality; there is no possibility to purchase the program once and for all. Consequently, this milkingware has been replaced with an alternative that can be bought instead of rented and was subsequently uninstalled."", ""Very good content and presentation with clear explanations. The app experience could be a tiny bit more refined, but for what it does it's great. I use it in combination with Swim Coach."", ""Great app so far, I just wish there was a way to reset your training plan and swim stats. I accidentally completed a workout I hadn't done yet, just wish I could undo those stats. Otherwise the app is super simple and dummy proof!"", ""Great swimming app. Just wish there were exercises for pull buoys and snorkel. Taking off a star and uninstalling because you can't choose which strokes you'd like to focus on or what equipment you have (I'd like pull buoy and snorkel exercises)."", ""As a former swimmer with respectful results in junior competition in my country, i'm delighted by this phenomenal app! Now, i'm 33 years old and trying to rebuild my condition and maybe take part in veteran's competitions. This app is very helpful for me because it provides me daily with great workouts. Congratulations guys! One dilemma though - if i have for example 3x100m freestyle with 30 sec rest, does it means rest after each 100's or after i complete all 3? Thanks for answer in advance"", 'For beginners who want to learn swim better with strictured plan and drills, this is the app! It helps me a lot of improving my swimming techniques in short of time. Thanks!', ""They are a great service to sort out what you might want to train up for in the swimming pool, the next thing I'd appreciate is if they could make some dry-land workout routines I could follow."", 'Great suppport service. I was unable to use the app due to a mistaken ""connection issue"". They fixed it right away, and I\'m now the happiest guy in the pool with my app.', ""I wish I could print the exercises with more details. I started bringing my phone in a water bag and check the numbers in the pool, so I don't have to spend a lot of time memorizing them"", ""The app is a great resource! But I'm only interested in the material, and not the device tracking features as I don't have one. Is it possible to make a cheaper plan to get access to all the resources?"", 'Absolutely loving it so far! I used to swim competitively and am now coming back to swimming as a form of working out. Exactly what I was looking for.']",io.swimup.application,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.swimup.application&hl=en&gl=us
