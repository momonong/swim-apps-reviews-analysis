,,,,,,"Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It‚Äôs less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.
I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it‚Äôs for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.","Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It‚Äôs less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.

,,,,,,,,"Positive: The coaching side seems ok and decent price compared to others. Needs Improvement: Watch app The watch up has a very basic screen in pool swim mode. Only distance, time, heart rate and calories. Split time can‚Äôt be changed while swimming, you are stuck with it when you begin, need to be chosen. No time/100m etc available. Apple fitness integration. Pool swim recorded as open water swim in Apple Fitness. No detail on splits / sets available in Apple fitness. Just distance and heart rate during swim. So integration not working too well. iPhone application Coaching section looks ok but I‚Äôve not tested it. There is only a high level summary available on swims: Distance, Duration, Pace (over whole session including rest), Calories, Average Heart Rate over whole session. So fairly useless to track how well one has done by set. Since I have a coach, cancelled subscription. Not useful for me.","Positive: The coaching side seems ok and decent price compared to others.

"This app is very easy to use. I love how you can send and sync workouts to your watch ‚Äì this can take a few tries, but I don‚Äôt fault DuoSwim for this since every phone-watch connected app has this problem. Swim workouts are tailored for all abilities from beginner swimmers to advanced. 

You can also log kick and drills on the apple watch when you choose an open goal swim, this is very useful to get the correct swim distance.

,Very nice app not so complicated as others. I will start my journey from tomorrow. It might be nice if you add a pdf format for the workouts. Just a suggestion really. Also as a master swimmer I would appreciate some plans based on ages/ability etc. As I purchased the gold membership it would be nice to add some more options for the nutrition section and maybe some advise for dry land exercises before swimming? Well done very good job!,,,,,,,,,,

,,,"In general, it works well. Keeps track of workout and is easy to read. My one gripe is the way the workout builder is set up. You can't do repeat intervals, only rest intervals. You can't set rest times below 10 seconds, so no 25s w/ 5s rest. They've limited the interval distances available. You can't do 225s or 350s if you wanted. Most annoyingly, you can't do a 1650 even though that is the short course yard competition equivalent of the 1500m.",,,,,,"In general, it works well. Keeps track of workout and is easy to read.

,,,,,,,,,,,"I originally purchased a pair 12/2019. Despite some early issues the goggles performed flawlessly afterwards. They are a major motivator to swim regularly and stimulate me to better my times. While competitive swimmers are probably all familiar with Form's goggles, I highly recommend them for casual swimmers like me who, at 60, is staying healthy by taking swimming up again after 45 years. Fantastic service, great product."
,,,,,,,,,,,Nice clean ans simple app interface. So far I had 4 sessions and I love it. It is very helpful to see running clock vs specific metrics in goggles. Would be nice to have ability to change metrics in the pool. So far I learned how to set metrics on the phone and synch before a pool session.
,,,,,,,,,,,"The goggles have given me more focus and direction to work on specific elements of training. Real-time feedback on times and heart rates (with polar OH1+ sensor on goggle strap) is great. The ability to easily build your own sessions in the app and transfer them to the goggles is fantastic, and the process is surprisingly straightforward. Definitely a fan!"
,,,,,,,,,,,"Update: The so continues to improve. The import from TP is excellent. Upgrading to 5* Suggestion: Link up with Magic 5 and get them to produce compatible eye cups/seals. Would be awesome. So far so good. Used the goggles and app for a week. It's been very good. Will come back and give an update after I have used it longer. Could be improved if workouts were CSS based, but I guess I'll get over that small issue."

Who else has access to my data and where did I consent to that?) Could we also expect some further integrations in the future? (e.g. Google Fit?)",,,,,,,,,,,"I love the goggles and the app!

,,,,,,,,,,,"The FORM app and goggles itself are of superb quality and I'm a very happy triathlete because of it. They have been fundamental to my training Why two stars then? While, that's all because I feel FORM is changing the rules of the game while we are playing. They have introduced guided workouts (great!) but decided to put it behind a subscription. I disagree with this decision but even worse - the price is completely ridiculous. 19 EUR by month? Really? I seriously thought this was a mistake.."

"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I‚Äôve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch‚Äôs inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It‚Äôs my only future feature request!",,,,,,,,,,,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment.

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion.

My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim.

However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don‚Äôt have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There‚Äôs no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don‚Äôt take the proper steps of progression then I don‚Äôt get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",
,,,,,,,"This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. 

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. 

Thanks for a game changing product!",,,,

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

,,"Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I‚Äôve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn‚Äôt impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch.

,,,,,,,,,,"I am not a compet√≠os swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It‚Äôs so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I‚Äôm leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I‚Äôm not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what‚Äôs next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don‚Äôt have one of these (I didn‚Äôt at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.",
,,,,,,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn‚Äôt think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they‚Äôve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****","Very impressed.

"Let‚Äôs be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master‚Äôs swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure.

And if that weren‚Äôt enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal.

,,,,,,,,,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That‚Äôs not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I‚Äôve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that‚Äôs only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn‚Äôt come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.","I use this app with my Apple watch 3.

"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn‚Äôt even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called ‚Äúget wet‚Äù. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",,,,,,,,,"This is the most complicated app for beginners.

,,,,,,,,,,"I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  
I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  
I took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It‚Äôs a win, win, win!!!!",
,,,,,,,,,"Save your money if you use a different watch.
Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn‚Äôt wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn‚Äôt share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I‚Äôve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.",,
,,,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The ‚Äúworkout of the day‚Äù feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not ‚Äúon the go‚Äù intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,"I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. 

Highly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It's the best app on my phone!",
,,,,,,,,,"I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn‚Äôt track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I‚Äôm not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won‚Äôt even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??",,

,,,,,,,,,,"I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn‚Äôt sold. 

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I‚Äôm not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn‚Äôt match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I‚Äôm behind. 

I definitely wouldn‚Äôt pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I‚Äôll try it out again.",

,,,,,,,,,,"App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn‚Äôt accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn‚Äôt appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I‚Äôll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit.

Watch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses.

So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal.

I have only been using the app about 2 months, and have become a much better swimmer, and I am 65 years old. And, my swimming began seriously about 4 months ago.

My only recommendation would be to just add a free swim to add as a workout. An example, swim freestyle for whatever distance time allows without stopping, and to be able to add notes or tools used during the swim.",

For nearly $200 a year, I just can't justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I'm going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro's pricing is more in line with market rates.",,
,,,,,,,,,,"As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you‚Äôre not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can‚Äôt get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It‚Äôs impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.

Supports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...

Then I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! ‚ÄúBring me a rock. No not that rock‚Äù. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we‚Äôll see who they try to blame.

And trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots.

,,,,,,,,,,The workouts are not challenging or tailored to my performance‚Äîannoying since the app has spent nearly 2 years collecting my data. The videos and various workouts can all be found (better) on the internet. Hardly worth $119. You‚Äôll also receive all sorts of emails and ‚Äútraining‚Äù videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they‚Äôre in a partnership with‚Äîlike a $200 device to build lung capacity. This may be helpful for beginners but if you‚Äôre an intermediate or above swimmer it‚Äôs not worth the money.,

,,,,,,,,,I use the app with my Apple Watch and it's great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much,,

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",,"PROS

,,,,,,,,,,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.",

My group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the ""log"" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool.

They also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.",

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

‚Ä¢ No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

‚Ä¢ 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

‚Ä¢ The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

‚Ä¢ The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

‚Ä¢ I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

‚Ä¢ The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

‚Ä¢ There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. 

I hope this gets better.",,"I don't know where to begin.

"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,"I‚Äôm writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it‚Äôs not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap ‚ÄúApple TV‚Äù it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don‚Äôt have an Apple TV, so I can‚Äôt get that code. And there‚Äôs no way to cancel or back out of this dialog ‚Äì I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I‚Äôll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn‚Äôt work without having to commit to a year‚Äôs subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good ‚Äî the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings ‚Äî even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I‚Äôm still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen ‚Äî I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one‚Ä¶ which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It‚Äôs enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable ‚Äî incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a ‚Äúresume workout‚Äù button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn‚Äôt clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue‚Ä¶ the previous workout that didn‚Äôt crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same ‚Äî 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again ‚Äî this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn‚Äôt the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn‚Äôt have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It‚Äôs clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.","I‚Äôm writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it‚Äôs not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap ‚ÄúApple TV‚Äù it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don‚Äôt have an Apple TV, so I can‚Äôt get that code. And there‚Äôs no way to cancel or back out of this dialog ‚Äì I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I‚Äôll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn‚Äôt work without having to commit to a year‚Äôs subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good ‚Äî the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings ‚Äî even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I‚Äôm still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen ‚Äî I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one‚Ä¶ which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It‚Äôs enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable ‚Äî incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a ‚Äúresume workout‚Äù button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn‚Äôt clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue‚Ä¶ the previous workout that didn‚Äôt crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same ‚Äî 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again ‚Äî this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn‚Äôt the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn‚Äôt have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It‚Äôs clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

,,,,,,,,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall. I can build it but anytime I try to save it it is asking me to upgrade and won‚Äôt save it.  Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don‚Äôt need nor want the coaching help. I just want an app that I can create/save/log workouts,,,

Surprisingly I can still put the watch into theater mode despite what official support site says - with two presses of the button. I've done three swims so far. Sad to say, the tracking's been a total mess. Using the app to merge intervals and laps, I've managed to fix one workout, but was forced to delete two workouts which were unfixable (where I swam the speed of an Olympic champion, or across the lap in 3 strokes).  EDIT 15/9 - Discovered that the previous problems was due to swimming with hand paddles. If I swim without hand paddles, the tracking seems to detect the laps and strokes pretty accurately (tested across 3 swim sessions), and only gets the intervals wrong which is fixable in the app later.

The whole reason I bought the pebble time was to record swimming work outs... Needless to say the app doesn't work with the time and is a complete hassle and waste to try and get it to connect.,,,,,,,,,,,

Can't even say what it is like because despite advertising pebble time support it can't connect to it as it doesn't even recognise that the pebble time uses a different pebble app on your phone from a normal pebble.

Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I‚Äôm not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I‚Äôm improving.",,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,"They‚Äôve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it‚Äôs easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I‚Äôm a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better‚Ä¶even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets. 

Still, I do like the improvements they‚Äôve made in the last few years. Keep working on it.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"At 70 yo I sometimes ( no, all the time) need motivation in these times to get up and do something healthy   Keeping track of my daily yardage and checking cumulative weekly, monthly and annual yards against others in similar age groups keeps me getting up early and driving daily to the Y.  Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I‚Äôm still a tortoise but it‚Äôs getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.",,

,,,,,,,,,This app is great when it works. Just after the new iOS update the app has been buggy and lost two of my swims. IÔ∏è like that it handles rest between intervals and sets. IÔ∏è also like to set the drill mode. The Apple Watch workout app tracks in the background and it adds to your rings.  Ending a workout can be a pain since the way the Apple Watch and app are relying on pressure. Did a 4000 yard workout with my masters group and the app locked up and lost the workout. It needs serious fixes and an update. May go back to apples fitness app which is harder to handle IÔ∏è. The water for drill sets.,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,"Only complaint is there‚Äôs no option to NOT put in distance. Sometimes I just swim for ‚Äútime‚Äù and don‚Äôt count the distance. App requires a multiple to place in the distance box.

,,,,,,,,,I‚Äôve used this App for 4 years and over the last year it has been crashing and dropping my swims halfway through my 3500 yard sessions. I regularly have to check and manually add 1300+ yard sets to accurately track my total distance.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration.

,,,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work. 

At this point between your faulty features and terrible customer service I'll wait to deal with one of your competitors that gets custom pool sizes into their app.","Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work.

- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I‚Äôll definitely keep using it!",,

Distance is much more accurate than with Apple Watch, and it even includes breast stroke distance, but calories only appear in iPhone fitness app after a lag, and don‚Äôt count towards daily move goal. Distance appears to be the inaccurate Apple Watch measure. Also, there‚Äôs no information about strokes swum. 

I‚Äôll wait until these bugs are fixed before using swim.com to track my swims.",,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"This is the best lap tracker I‚Äôve found, however, there‚Äôs one annoying thing about its integration with the phone‚Äôs activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I‚Äôm at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone‚Äôs Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I‚Äôm fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It‚Äôs nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval‚Äôs progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

,,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",,,,,,,"***Update - 02-10-2017

Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",,,

,,,,,,,,"I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach. After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it‚Äôs videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I‚Äôm impressed!",,"I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach.

,,,"They put me on 2 levels before champion but the workouts are way too easy. I also told the survey, I swim for 2 hrs and a minimum of 5000 yards. The training they give me is less than 2 hrs and WAY less than 5000 yards.",,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,"I love Swimup‚Äôs YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It‚Äôs a nice minimalistic app that‚Äôs simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn‚Äôt there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup‚Äôs YouTube videos because of the explanations. It‚Äôs very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn‚Äôt live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",
,,,,,,,,,,No voice tutorials makes these videos useless.,
