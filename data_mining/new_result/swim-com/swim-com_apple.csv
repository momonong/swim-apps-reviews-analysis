Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",4,False,ENC iOS Reviews,Improved tracking but data analysis still weak,AppStore

There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).

Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing.

So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers.

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.

209,2016-12-26 03:19:12,,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",3,False,tmillsgroninger,Poor execution,AppStore
210,2016-12-23 18:44:24,,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work.

231,2017-02-10 17:59:18,,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",2,False,Immeherenow,Great Concept. Poor Execution.,AppStore
