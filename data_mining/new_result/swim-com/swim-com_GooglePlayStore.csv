The data is there with an upload button, but it gives ""upload unsuccessful"" every time. I contacted support, but they were totally unhelpful: their recommendation was to manually enter total time/distance (and accept losing all pace & heart rate data).",1,9,5.4.3,2023-07-26 04:50:29,,,5.4.3,GooglePlayStore

Unfortunately it frustrates me that when I swim it tracks my distance up to 550m and then thats it. It will not track further than that when I'm swimming 1600m. There has not been a time where it completely tracked my whole swim. Everytime I see an update I try the app again and I get disappointed. Thats the reason I bought the watch and got the app. I'm hoping it will get fix VER SOON!,2,2,1.5,2015-05-26 20:01:23,"Hi Fred,

Are you swimming the whole 1600m straight or resting at any point?  If resting or kicking, the app needs to be paused by pressing the middle button on the Pebble.
