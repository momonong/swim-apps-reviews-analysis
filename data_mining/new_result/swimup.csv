I tried out the first 2 recommended workouts and liked them a lot, but now it won't generate any more and I don't have a subscription. Are there only 2 accessible workouts per mode without a subscription? Also some of the drill descriptions are hard to understand (in English).

Most of the workout in the personal plan seems to be a rearrangement of the existing training plans.

Normally this should have locked in my subscription, instead I was refunded the money and forced to pay again because of new pricing.
