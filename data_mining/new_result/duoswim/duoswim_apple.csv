Happy swimming!', 'modified': '2023-02-20T12:47:51Z'}","Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It‚Äôs less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.
I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it‚Äôs for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.",5,False,Nicola9.4,"Amazing app, some improvements needed",AppStore

There are hundreds of expert designed workouts nicely separated into sections which you can select depending on your area of focus.   
Features such as the pre and post pool mobility exercises are really helpful and something which I haven‚Äôt seen before on other workout apps. 
Also, being able to see how far I have swam in total and how many workouts I have completed is extremely motivating and rewarding to see. 
Overall, I would highly recommend this app to anyone at any level of swimming.",5,False,kn97xo,Highly recommend,AppStore

We really appreciate you taking the time to review DuoSwim and provide us with such detailed feedback. We are pleased to hear you like many features of the app and our development team will be looking into your recommendations.\n\nWe are currently designing and developing features that help swimmers who already have a coach, or are part of a swim team. Your feedback will help contribute to how we design these features moving forward. In terms of Apple fitness, we are currently working closely with Apple developers to create the best swimming analytics experience in our next version. We are also planning to integrate with many other apps as part of this work. If you would like to chat about this, please send an email to our team at feedback@duoswim.com.', 'modified': '2023-01-16T11:02:57Z'}","Positive: The coaching side seems ok and decent price compared to others. Needs Improvement: Watch app The watch up has a very basic screen in pool swim mode. Only distance, time, heart rate and calories. Split time can‚Äôt be changed while swimming, you are stuck with it when you begin, need to be chosen. No time/100m etc available. Apple fitness integration. Pool swim recorded as open water swim in Apple Fitness. No detail on splits / sets available in Apple fitness. Just distance and heart rate during swim. So integration not working too well. iPhone application Coaching section looks ok but I‚Äôve not tested it. There is only a high level summary available on swims: Distance, Duration, Pace (over whole session including rest), Calories, Average Heart Rate over whole session. So fairly useless to track how well one has done by set. Since I have a coach, cancelled subscription. Not useful for me.",2,False,Swiss-Swiss,"Watch app is very limited, integration apple fitness weak.",AppStore

The recent addition of the swims and sprints feature has been very well received, and keeps you motivated to archive a goal distance. It would be fun to have additional functions like ‚Äúcreate your own workout‚Äù or ‚Äòrandom workout‚Äô. 

Overall, I am extremely impressed with the app and the integration with apple watch, functionally it is great. Having some extra metrics would be cool and badges on the profile, but this isn‚Äôt a priority. Thumbs up from me and 5 stars.",5,True,SCS2608,A brilliant app,AppStore

I love how you can send and sync workouts to your watch ‚Äì this can take a few tries, but I don‚Äôt fault DuoSwim for this since every phone-watch connected app has this problem. Swim workouts are tailored for all abilities from beginner swimmers to advanced. 

You can also log kick and drills on the apple watch when you choose an open goal swim, this is very useful to get the correct swim distance. Overall, a very promising app that has potential to be great! Great job guys! üèäüèäüëç",5,False,kjmts01,Great for all swimmers!,AppStore
