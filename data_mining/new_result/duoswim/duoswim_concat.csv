0,2023-02-16 16:47:48,"Fantastic app, it changed my way to workout in the swimming pool. It‚Äôs less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers. Helpful and friendly customer service too.
I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it‚Äôs for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.",5,"Amazing app, some improvements needed",AppStore,,,
1,2023-12-01 18:08:43,"Brilliant app which not only looks great but works really well. 
There are hundreds of expert designed workouts nicely separated into sections which you can select depending on your area of focus.   
Features such as the pre and post pool mobility exercises are really helpful and something which I haven‚Äôt seen before on other workout apps. 
Also, being able to see how far I have swam in total and how many workouts I have completed is extremely motivating and rewarding to see. 
Overall, I would highly recommend this app to anyone at any level of swimming.",5,Highly recommend,AppStore,,,
2,2023-01-14 18:32:17,"Positive: The coaching side seems ok and decent price compared to others. Needs Improvement: Watch app The watch up has a very basic screen in pool swim mode. Only distance, time, heart rate and calories. Split time can‚Äôt be changed while swimming, you are stuck with it when you begin, need to be chosen. No time/100m etc available. Apple fitness integration. Pool swim recorded as open water swim in Apple Fitness. No detail on splits / sets available in Apple fitness. Just distance and heart rate during swim. So integration not working too well. iPhone application Coaching section looks ok but I‚Äôve not tested it. There is only a high level summary available on swims: Distance, Duration, Pace (over whole session including rest), Calories, Average Heart Rate over whole session. So fairly useless to track how well one has done by set. Since I have a coach, cancelled subscription. Not useful for me.",2,"Watch app is very limited, integration apple fitness weak.",AppStore,,,
3,2022-06-12 10:13:29,"Finally a swim app that looks great and provides superb workouts. The recent addition of the swims and sprints feature has been very well received, and keeps you motivated to archive a goal distance. It would be fun to have additional functions like ‚Äúcreate your own workout‚Äù or ‚Äòrandom workout‚Äô. 

Overall, I am extremely impressed with the app and the integration with apple watch, functionally it is great. Having some extra metrics would be cool and badges on the profile, but this isn‚Äôt a priority. Thumbs up from me and 5 stars.",5,A brilliant app,AppStore,,,
4,2022-06-11 19:02:41,"This app is very easy to use. I love how you can send and sync workouts to your watch ‚Äì this can take a few tries, but I don‚Äôt fault DuoSwim for this since every phone-watch connected app has this problem. Swim workouts are tailored for all abilities from beginner swimmers to advanced. 

You can also log kick and drills on the apple watch when you choose an open goal swim, this is very useful to get the correct swim distance. Overall, a very promising app that has potential to be great! Great job guys! üèäüèäüëç",5,Great for all swimmers!,AppStore,,,
5,2022-05-30 08:49:37,Perfect app. Used to love swimming but hadn‚Äôt regularly swam for many years. This app has helped me on a journey and I now look forward to my regular swims 3 times a week. Im working through the training plans and love the ease of recording sessions and the regular updates. Well done highly recommended to anyone wanting to get back in the pool or for those wanting professional detailed sessions.,5,Got me back into the pool - loving it !!,AppStore,,,
6,2023-12-01 12:03:04,"Was looking for fresh ideas for open water swimming and triathlon orientated sets. Really easy to use application and I particularly appreciate the feature that lets you know what equipment you will need for the session.

Would recommend this app to any swimmer that would like extra guidance and structure with their training.",5,Great app,AppStore,,,
7,2022-06-12 09:45:46,"After trying a few apps for my swimming, the DuoSwim app is my favourite and less complicated to use than others. Honestly, I don‚Äôt find any issues with this app personally and like how new features are added regularly. Well done guys!",5,Best swimming app,AppStore,,,
8,2023-12-08 10:19:51,Great app for when looking to get back in the pool after a few months off. Gives a structured plan and varies it up day to day!,5,Great app,AppStore,,,
9,2021-05-11 13:52:59,"This is the first app I have found where I can have access to a variety of training sessions that I can follow to improve my swimming. The range of drills used in the sessions keeps it interesting.  A great addition to the app is the videos, this is perfect for visualising and learning skills. The training journey enables me to track my progress and the attention to detail to ensure you can see results is amazing. I love that there is inspiration for nutrition with recipes to try too! I recommend for anyone wanting to improve their swimming in any capacity.",5,Amazing tool for swim training,AppStore,,,
10,2022-01-28 23:24:05,Very nice app not so complicated as others. I will start my journey from tomorrow. It might be nice if you add a pdf format for the workouts. Just a suggestion really. Also as a master swimmer I would appreciate some plans based on ages/ability etc. As I purchased the gold membership it would be nice to add some more options for the nutrition section and maybe some advise for dry land exercises before swimming? Well done very good job!,5,5 star App,AppStore,,,
11,2021-05-11 10:16:11,"This app was exactly what I needed to start training more effectively and efficiently. I‚Äôve already started feeling more confident and motivated in the pool. 

The app is easy to use and it provides a wide variety of training plans and workouts with additional technique videos which are super helpful. 

I would highly recommend for anyone who is serious about swimming!",5,Just what I needed!,AppStore,,,
12,2021-04-29 08:24:46,"I currently swim 2-3 times a week and this app is fantastic for allowing me to track, plan, and follow training plans that are perfect for me. The training videos really help to see visually what I should be doing and allow me to follow my progress as I love through the training plans. Fantastic advice on nutrition is a welcome bonus!",5,Brilliant Swimming App!,AppStore,,,
13,2022-01-21 15:18:34,"This app is quality, helping me build up my swimming skills and a lot cheaper than buying a coach every week that doesn‚Äôt even do as good a job. Fully recommend to anyone who wants to build endurance pace and swimming ability.",5,Amazing,AppStore,,,
