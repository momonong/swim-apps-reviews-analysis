I would just improve the Apple Watch layout when working out because the top section gets covered by the watch time and water lock sign, so you miss out some info the app displays. 
I also find the pace at which the beginner repetitions are set to be too fast, sometimes I have to pause the workout to be able to catch up. I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it‚Äôs for beginners.
However, still a great app and still 5 stars.",5,"Amazing app, some improvements needed",AppStore,,,,duoswim,0.3340277777777778,0.6576388888888889

Only distance, time, heart rate and calories. Split time can‚Äôt be changed while swimming, you are stuck with it when you begin, need to be chosen. No time/100m etc available. Apple fitness integration. Pool swim recorded as open water swim in Apple Fitness. No detail on splits / sets available in Apple fitness. Just distance and heart rate during swim. So integration not working too well. iPhone application Coaching section looks ok but I‚Äôve not tested it. There is only a high level summary available on swims: Distance, Duration, Pace (over whole session including rest), Calories, Average Heart Rate over whole session.

However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I‚Äôve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch‚Äôs inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too.

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can‚Äôt see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",5,Very motivating,AppStore,,,,form-swim,0.20818181818181822,0.5400000000000001

234,2021-09-30 00:45:51,"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM‚Äôs only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ‚Ä¶.FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",2,Does not sync to Apple Health,AppStore,,,,form-swim,0.10091354723707667,0.49291443850267364
235,2020-11-13 12:30:30,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn‚Äôt purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you‚Äôll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don‚Äôt own any other devices because I don‚Äôt compete much and I‚Äôm not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I‚Äôve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don‚Äôt own other devices, I‚Äôve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I‚Äôve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I‚Äôve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach‚Äôs mantra: ‚ÄúIf unsure, do more.‚Äù So I‚Äôd do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It‚Äôs one thing to have a good turnover but if you‚Äôre just windmilling down the lane it‚Äôs no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I‚Äôm very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....ü§£",5,Great Training Tech,AppStore,,,,form-swim,0.19304632705795494,0.525669066076043

Parameter Settings->Workouts->RestTimeBetweenSets does not work, if you point 10 secs, 15 secs, etc. - on watch side (Garmin F6XP) the MySwimPro app ALWAYS countdowns 30 secs between Sets and 60 secs between Groups. 3. After Workout ended, saved and watch synced (App option ""Garmin pair & authorized sync"" are turned on) - App's Activities had not shown in my Feeds/Profile until I re-installed App. 4. Watch App (Garmin) does not vibrate a watch device while you are out of / back to HR Zone described for Sets.",2,,GooglePlayStore,16.0,7.7.5,7.7.5,myswimpro,0.109375,0.509375

It has a lot of bad reviews and look that this company is not interested in fixing its issues. Also the company take time to reply reviews to explain the issue blaming Garmin of its poor behavior. My reply for this is very direct. MySwimPro if you don't have a a ready Production App do not put that in the market or allows Garmin to set that in its app store you are misleading clients like me of getting into an expensive subscription that does not work. and where the first response that you have as a company is to delegate the responsibility of you poor quality and control to other like Garmin,1,,GooglePlayStore,7.0,5.0.62,5.0.62,myswimpro,-0.16699999999999998,0.5152142857142856

576,2017-04-28 12:49:03,"I think it's a good idea, decent app. I  believe it's too expensive to see the trainings tho! 100$ a year is too much. Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.   I'd suggest asking for times or usual swimming trainings and then the app could actually suggest times/distances according to that?

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I‚Äôve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn‚Äôt impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can‚Äôt keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I‚Äôm leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I‚Äôm not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches.

But they‚Äôve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",5,From Analytics to Coaching,AppStore,,,,myswimpro,0.24753623188405796,0.477463768115942

Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren‚Äôt enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday.

You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That‚Äôs not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I‚Äôve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that‚Äôs only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn‚Äôt come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful.

686,2023-08-04 03:05:33,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn‚Äôt even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called ‚Äúget wet‚Äù. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",2,Complicated,AppStore,,,,myswimpro,0.06444444444444444,0.39862433862433855

However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds).

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn‚Äôt already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It‚Äôs the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

All of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!

I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water üíß lock, had to swipe right, tap the ‚Äúnext rep‚Äù button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I‚Äôm brand new to this app, so I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you‚Äôll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you‚Äôve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I‚Äôm so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it‚Äôll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I‚Äôm able to know the true distance I‚Äôve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you‚Äôve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you‚Äôve swam that full distance or not, lol üòÇ this may be great for some people.",3,Bummer.,AppStore,,,,myswimpro,0.07766126516126517,0.37165867165867167

1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",3,Mixed Feelings,AppStore,,,,myswimpro,0.17955182072829134,0.5426237161531278

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

‚Ä¢ No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

‚Ä¢ 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

‚Ä¢ The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

‚Ä¢ The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

‚Ä¢ I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

‚Ä¢ The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

‚Ä¢ There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

1175,2017-05-29 04:45:40,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",2,Very limited app,AppStore,,,,myswimpro,0.14130434782608692,0.6634057971014492
1176,2017-01-06 06:18:12,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",1,lost workout - difficulty creating custom workouts,AppStore,,,,myswimpro,0.12211538461538463,0.5292506105006104

1180,2022-07-29 23:39:57,"I‚Äôm writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it‚Äôs not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap ‚ÄúApple TV‚Äù it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don‚Äôt have an Apple TV, so I can‚Äôt get that code. And there‚Äôs no way to cancel or back out of this dialog ‚Äì I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I‚Äôll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn‚Äôt work without having to commit to a year‚Äôs subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good ‚Äî the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings ‚Äî even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I‚Äôm still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen ‚Äî I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one‚Ä¶ which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It‚Äôs enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable ‚Äî incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a ‚Äúresume workout‚Äù button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn‚Äôt clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue‚Ä¶ the previous workout that didn‚Äôt crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same ‚Äî 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again ‚Äî this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn‚Äôt the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn‚Äôt have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It‚Äôs clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.)

Surprisingly I can still put the watch into theater mode despite what official support site says - with two presses of the button. I've done three swims so far. Sad to say, the tracking's been a total mess. Using the app to merge intervals and laps, I've managed to fix one workout, but was forced to delete two workouts which were unfixable (where I swam the speed of an Olympic champion, or across the lap in 3 strokes).  EDIT 15/9 - Discovered that the previous problems was due to swimming with hand paddles. If I swim without hand paddles, the tracking seems to detect the laps and strokes pretty accurately (tested across 3 swim sessions), and only gets the intervals wrong which is fixable in the app later.

Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I‚Äôm not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.

In functionality, my pool isn‚Äôt listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin.

1820,2016-12-26 03:19:12,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",3,Poor execution,AppStore,,,,swim-com,0.0178699436763953,0.44580133128520233
1821,2016-12-23 18:44:24,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work.

My sources are all setup in the health app. Nothing syncs. Started suddenly and for no apparent reason (no iOS or app updates happened between when it was working and now). I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling all sorts of apps. Restarting the phone and watch. Hard restarting the phone. Even restoring my iPhone. No dice. The biggest problem for me is that I no longer see a workout logged in activity app. I get the exercise credits because my heart rate was up, but no workout is logged. 

I have contacted the app developers several times. No response. I will have to stop using this app and start using the workout app. And manually logging kicking yards. I‚Äôd really much prefer to not do this, but oh well. Perhaps it‚Äôll start working at some point. Tomorrow I am going to try running both apps and see what happens.",2,Great until it stops syncing with the health app,AppStore,,,,swim-com,0.3345238095238095,0.5958333333333332
1840,2019-03-02 23:55:00,I have used this app with my old Apple Watch Series 2 and tried again with the Series 4. It continues to overestimate my laps. The native Apple Watch swimming app and MySwimPro are and have been both spot-on when it comes to counting my laps and distance. Not sure what the issue is with the Swim.com app and it‚Äôs a shame.

1842,2017-02-10 17:59:18,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",2,Great Concept. Poor Execution.,AppStore,,,,swim-com,0.17536725801431682,0.3781714908185496

I used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. 
Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",5,Amazing app,AppStore,,,,swimup,0.44615384615384623,0.5499999999999999

Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it‚Äôs videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool.

1913,2021-08-01 05:34:55,"I love Swimup‚Äôs YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It‚Äôs a nice minimalistic app that‚Äôs simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn‚Äôt there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup‚Äôs YouTube videos because of the explanations. It‚Äôs very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn‚Äôt live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",3,"I really want to like the app, I really do",AppStore,,,,swimup,0.1666433566433566,0.7370879120879121
