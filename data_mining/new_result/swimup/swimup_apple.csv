I am enjoying the app so much and it motivates me to go at least twice a week for swim. I find courses are very well made and help any aspiring swimmer at all levels. 
I used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. 
Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",5,False,Amazing app,satheeshka,AppStore

After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it’s videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I’m impressed!",4,False,Thank you!,lalamo25,AppStore

But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn’t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup’s YouTube videos because of the explanations. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn’t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",3,False,"I really want to like the app, I really do",cherrydiamzon,AppStore
