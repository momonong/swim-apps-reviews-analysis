0,"I put my phone in a plastic bag to use this app. XD It's sleek and easy to use. I tried out the first 2 recommended workouts and liked them a lot, but now it won't generate any more and I don't have a subscription. Are there only 2 accessible workouts per mode without a subscription? Also some of the drill descriptions are hard to understand (in English). Not a huge problem but I'm not familiar with all the drills. (Edit: the videos are really helpful though!)",4,36,1.97,2021-02-22 07:54:43,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
1,"The SwimUp app has helped me going to the pool regularly. Their personalized training plan is just right for me. Not too easy, not too hard so no need to look through endless lists of workout plans to find the right one.",5,3,2.0,2023-12-08 15:47:21,2.0,GooglePlayStore,
2,"Personnal plan seems good at first glance but when I ask for 800m workout, it always give me training longer than 1k, up to 1.8km. Most of the workout in the personal plan seems to be a rearrangement of the existing training plans. Exporting to the Garmin watch is working but you have to use the Garmin app, it's a 2 steps process every time, no direct connection with the watch. (Edited, 800m issue was fixed)",4,0,2.0,2023-12-15 01:41:12,2.0,GooglePlayStore,
3,"A lot of potential and probably the best of the kind in many aspects, including usability. But it is very limited and it seems development is completely stagnant. No option to remove workouts, restart program, increase workout duration/length or chose which equipment you have. Also doesn't export/import from Garmin or Polar. Very disappointed. It would have so much potential if it wasn't abandoned...",2,17,1.97,2021-12-11 01:35:19,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
4,"The app is decent, I am using it, but the behavior in regards to sales is terrible, I have bought an yearly subscription at a very markdown price. Normally this should have locked in my subscription, instead I was refunded the money and forced to pay again because of new pricing. Buying a subscription means that it should be respected, if it was sold at a low price to gain customers, it means you made a conscious choice to loose money on initial marketing and leads.",3,15,1.98,2023-05-14 20:14:12,1.98,GooglePlayStore,
5,"An excellent app. I've been following Swimup on YouTube since it was first created. Pin point error correction, solutions and excelent effective training ideas on adult swimming. Program includes all basic and all advance levels and END and SPRT modes with using tools where necessary. I made my subscription on 2021 August 1st. I took many private lessons and group work so far, but I have never had such a rapid and effective development until now. You must try, time is valuable.",5,21,1.97,2021-08-31 19:00:30,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
6,"Subscription schemes to bleed customers dry ad infinitum are the only option offered to obtain the software's full functionality; there is no possibility to purchase the program once and for all. Consequently, this milkingware has been replaced with an alternative that can be bought instead of rented and was subsequently uninstalled.",2,1,,2023-06-28 22:18:50,,GooglePlayStore,
7,The app is continuously stopping ..,1,1,2.0,2023-11-29 02:23:41,2.0,GooglePlayStore,
8,"If only they got rid of those generic photos of that male swimmer from the start screen. And add some HD photos of Olympians, familiar faces for each category. This app would look immensely cleaner! Performance wise : the app won't save your work if you take a call or switch tabs from another app during your workout for some reason.",4,8,1.97,2021-07-20 11:35:49,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
9,"Would rate five stars if we had the option to select what equipment is available to us and tailor the workouts around that. Ex: not swimming in a pool so unable to do exercises based on pushing off the wall, etc. Also would like to be able to select less than 250m and less than 20 min on the set up questionnaire for complete beginners.",4,14,1.97,2021-06-03 16:58:39,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
10,"Very good content and presentation with clear explanations. The app experience could be a tiny bit more refined, but for what it does it's great. I use it in combination with Swim Coach.",4,8,1.97,2020-10-01 12:20:17,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
11,Great swimming app. Just wish there were exercises for pull buoys and snorkel. Taking off a star and uninstalling because you can't choose which strokes you'd like to focus on or what equipment you have (I'd like pull buoy and snorkel exercises).,4,18,1.97,2021-07-22 21:40:58,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
12,"Great app so far, I just wish there was a way to reset your training plan and swim stats. I accidentally completed a workout I hadn't done yet, just wish I could undo those stats. Otherwise the app is super simple and dummy proof!",5,28,1.97,2020-09-28 22:32:28,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
13,"As a former swimmer with respectful results in junior competition in my country, i'm delighted by this phenomenal app! Now, i'm 33 years old and trying to rebuild my condition and maybe take part in veteran's competitions. This app is very helpful for me because it provides me daily with great workouts. Congratulations guys! One dilemma though - if i have for example 3x100m freestyle with 30 sec rest, does it means rest after each 100's or after i complete all 3? Thanks for answer in advance",5,14,1.97,2020-09-17 19:30:45,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
14,"They are a great service to sort out what you might want to train up for in the swimming pool, the next thing I'd appreciate is if they could make some dry-land workout routines I could follow.",5,6,1.98,2023-10-13 05:10:28,1.98,GooglePlayStore,
15,"For beginners who want to learn swim better with strictured plan and drills, this is the app! It helps me a lot of improving my swimming techniques in short of time. Thanks!",5,6,1.97,2021-05-13 01:15:49,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
16,"Great suppport service. I was unable to use the app due to a mistaken ""connection issue"". They fixed it right away, and I'm now the happiest guy in the pool with my app.",5,9,1.98,2023-05-19 23:22:29,1.98,GooglePlayStore,
17,"I wish I could print the exercises with more details. I started bringing my phone in a water bag and check the numbers in the pool, so I don't have to spend a lot of time memorizing them",4,2,1.98,2022-12-16 04:24:44,1.98,GooglePlayStore,
18,"The app is a great resource! But I'm only interested in the material, and not the device tracking features as I don't have one. Is it possible to make a cheaper plan to get access to all the resources?",5,4,1.98,2023-07-11 20:29:39,1.98,GooglePlayStore,
19,Absolutely loving it so far! I used to swim competitively and am now coming back to swimming as a form of working out. Exactly what I was looking for.,5,2,1.97,2020-09-28 05:12:05,1.97,GooglePlayStore,
20,"Excellent content, but - you must adding option for Android watches. Like garnim watch ( as competitors have ) . You have a lot users like my, with Android phones / watches, and this feature is necessary for exercises into the pool. Thank you !!",4,3,1.98,2022-09-07 15:50:59,1.98,GooglePlayStore,

61,"Amazing app, amazing coach and superb courses. I am enjoying the app so much and it motivates me to go at least twice a week for swim. I find courses are very well made and help any aspiring swimmer at all levels. 
I used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. 
Thank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses",5,,,2023-05-07 17:56:00,,AppStore,Amazing app
62,"Learning to swim has been such an amazing journey for me, and this app has truly been a game-changer. The lessons are well-structured, making it easy to progress from basics to more advanced techniques. What I love most is the tracking feature. It keeps me motivated by showing my progress over time. The videos are super helpful, and the tips have been invaluable. Highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their swimming skills.",5,,,2023-12-14 10:50:01,,AppStore,Good app

64,"I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach. After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it’s videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I’m impressed!",4,,,2023-04-04 14:55:04,,AppStore,Thank you!

68,"I love Swimup’s YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It’s a nice minimalistic app that’s simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn’t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup’s YouTube videos because of the explanations. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn’t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/",3,,,2021-08-01 05:34:55,,AppStore,"I really want to like the app, I really do"
