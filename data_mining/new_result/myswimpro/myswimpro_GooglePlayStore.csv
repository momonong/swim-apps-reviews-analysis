After Workout ended, saved and watch synced (App option ""Garmin pair & authorized sync"" are turned on) - App's Activities had not shown in my Feeds/Profile until I re-installed App. 4.

I tried to use on Garmin watch Fenix 5 and I don't know how an app like this has passed QA and how Garmin allows it on its application market. It has a lot of bad reviews and look that this company is not interested in fixing its issues. Also the company take time to reply reviews to explain the issue blaming Garmin of its poor behavior. My reply for this is very direct. MySwimPro if you don't have a a ready Production App do not put that in the market or allows Garmin to set that in its app store you are misleading clients like me of getting into an expensive subscription that does not work. and where the first response that you have as a company is to delegate the responsibility of you poor quality and control to other like Garmin,1,7,5.0.62,2019-10-08 03:23:48,We appreciate your feedback.The issue with CIQ recorded swim activities on the Fenix 5 that was causing the watch to crash when the activity was saved has been resolved by Garmin's recent Firmware update. If you Update your watch's Firmware to 9.0 the app will work as it is supposed to. Message us at support@myswimpro.com if you have any questions,2019-10-11 04:50:21,5.0.62,GooglePlayStore

Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.   I'd suggest asking for times or usual swimming trainings and then the app could actually suggest times/distances according to that?
