I don't particularly care to race, but I do want to swim faster, improve my techniques, and get the best swim workouts possible. This app helps me do just that. From the technique videos to guided workouts and monthly challenges, my swimpro has coached me to better swimming in a short time. Love this app!

However, as a past swimmer and current coach, the sets are somewhat stale, and the majority of them are behind what i would consider to be a decently high paywall. i get the desire to charge for this, but it shouldbt be nearly so expensive, and you shouls feel like you are getting a lot more for your money.

The video demonstration and the workout plan in one place is really helpful for someone who either is new to swimming or is an advanced swimmer.

It has a lot of bad reviews and look that this company is not interested in fixing its issues. Also the company take time to reply reviews to explain the issue blaming Garmin of its poor behavior. My reply for this is very direct. MySwimPro if you don't have a a ready Production App do not put that in the market or allows Garmin to set that in its app store you are misleading clients like me of getting into an expensive subscription that does not work. and where the first response that you have as a company is to delegate the responsibility of you poor quality and control to other like Garmin,1,,GooglePlayStore,7.0,5.0.62,5.0.62,myswimpro

Maybe if I had a watch and could benefit better from the app (like logging in times, for example, which I always forget by the time I get out of the pool). I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced. The intermediate trainings are just the right amount of distance I can take, but the times are huge! 4:00 for a sprint 100 is too much! But if I try the advanced trainings, the times are just right, but they're too long! I understand you can edit them but if you plan on paying for this it'd be nice to have something better.

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.",4,My Swim Pro Review,AppStore,,,,myswimpro

It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more.

683,2023-03-15 19:44:28,"Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****",5,From Analytics to Coaching,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
684,2019-11-12 20:14:20,"Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters.

685,2019-04-27 01:39:13,"I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. 
My workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!
I’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. 
Definitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. 
All in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.",5,Great for Pool and Open Water,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
686,2023-08-04 03:05:33,"This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.

Also, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. 

Anyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.",2,Complicated,AppStore,,,,myswimpro

Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.

I quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.

Got the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea.

691,2021-11-22 20:52:55,"First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.",5,Great but not fail safe,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
692,2022-07-06 01:26:52,"I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice.

That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. 

Honestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor.

I have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.

I bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven't managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.

This app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I've gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. 

Customer service is EXCELLENT - though I've never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it.

700,2022-10-29 07:06:52,"The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. 

The fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. 

The features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. 

Without the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: 

- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.
- track detailed swim times
- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim

What does the free version do? 

- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. 

Additionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. 

This app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief.

I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny.

The premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.

The community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. 

Love this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!

I like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. 

I’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. 

I would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). 

I have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind.

I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate.

When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data.

Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments.

The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.

However, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.

But even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).

731,2021-07-13 22:12:36,"when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.

let’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.

I’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.

Also, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.

* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts
* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.
* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused
* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off
* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.
* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.

988,2021-05-06 22:43:10,"I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.

Update: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.",3,Bummer.,AppStore,,,,myswimpro

1051,2016-11-15 09:36:20,"PROS
1. It's great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. 

2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.

OPPORTUNITIES 
1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I'd been doing.

2. I'm not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn't show up. This is something I'll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.

3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.

4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don't have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple's activity app.

Will swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn't purchase.",3,Mixed Feelings,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
1052,2016-07-16 21:14:37,"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it throughout the summer, and it's been helpful with planning sets when I'm working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off.

MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I'm swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I'm swimming and the improvement I'm making.

We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints.

One thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I'm a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities.

First of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. 

That being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. 

Right to it:

• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)

• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. 

• The force touch unlocking feature doesn't register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you've tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. 

• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a ""Lap"" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a ""Rest"" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. 

• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. 

• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked ""Next Set""...there was no going back, except starting all over again. 

• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy.

1175,2017-05-29 04:45:40,"It's a great app because it's the only swimming app for Apple Watch.
It's a very mediocre app for its capabilities. 
Its only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. 

The free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that's about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. 

To make short, the app doesn't do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you're swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It's advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. 

As a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. 

Complete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.

All in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.",2,Very limited app,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
1176,2017-01-06 06:18:12,"Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn't figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.

Worse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.

Finally, the website is garbage. Yes it's pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn't find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the ""team"" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn't seem like there's much competition.

Hopefully your luck is better than mine but I'm going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that's just for the free app. There's no way I'd pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don't mind paying for software.",1,lost workout - difficulty creating custom workouts,AppStore,,,,myswimpro

1178,2023-07-28 23:19:49,would most likely be a good app except for the fact that you can't do anything without a subscription im 14 years old and don't have $179.99 to spen in an app all i need to use is the dryland again seems like a really good app and has really good customer service but it's not for me (sorry if i offended anyone with this review),3,It's a no for me,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
1179,2022-11-21 18:10:46,"I started swimming 4 years ago at the age of 50 and stumbled upon this app through the YouTube videos that taught me how to swim. For 2+ years I put off paying the “extra” money for the coaching and other features available. Now that I did purchase the coaching, I have ZERO regrets. My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!",5,Incredible App and Support,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
1180,2022-07-29 23:39:57,"I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************
Update for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.",2,MySwimPro by MyProgrammingAmateur,AppStore,,,,myswimpro

One of my problems is that I don’t have a 6 digit code come up on my watch, though I don’t know if the problems from the app or my watch. If I could get an answer that would be nose. Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.",4,Great app! One problem,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
1182,2022-07-14 18:02:41,I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall. I can build it but anytime I try to save it it is asking me to upgrade and won’t save it.  Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don’t need nor want the coaching help. I just want an app that I can create/save/log workouts,1,Loved it Until this update,AppStore,,,,myswimpro
