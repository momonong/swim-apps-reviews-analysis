0,"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I‚Äôve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.
P. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch‚Äôs inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It‚Äôs my only future feature request!",5,Amazing!

1,"My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. 

I have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. 

Another benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can‚Äôt see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.",5,Very motivating,"['biggest question', 'started running Triathlon', 'running Triathlon events', 'easy to read', 'swimming', 'running Triathlon', 'Triathlon events', 'easy', 'open water', 'recently started running']","['form goggles', 'goggles decided', 'goggles', 'data glasses', 'glasses tell', 'glasses', 'watch swims', 'focus data', 'swimming dark', 'clear vision']"
2,"This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don‚Äôt know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!",5,I love these goggles,"['game changer', 'Form goggles', 'goggles', 'app', 'reliable swim tracking', 'game', 'changer', 'swim', 'reliable swim', 'required companion']","['swim tracking', 'goggles app', 'swim app', 'type goggles', 'form goggles', 'reliable swim', 'swims counting', 'goggles goggles', 'stroke type', 'love goggles']"
3,"The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don‚Äôt have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There‚Äôs no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don‚Äôt take the proper steps of progression then I don‚Äôt get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.",3,"It‚Äôs fine, but not revolutionary","['workout generation', 'googles are fine', 'generation is fine', 'fine', 'back', 'workout', 'week', 'n‚Äôt', 'plan', 'googles']","['pausing workout', 'workout generation', 'workout week', 'missed workouts', 'swims week', 'complete swims', 'start progression', 'workout plan', 'progression time', 'week unlock']"
4,"This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. 

My feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. 

Thanks for a game changing product!",5,Made me fall back in love with swimming,"['bone conduction headphones', 'bone conduction', 'conduction headphones', 'times a week', 'week', 'swimming 2-3 times', 'bone', 'conduction', 'headphones', 'swimming']","['workout planner', 'workout builder', 'swim pace', 'allowing workout', 'swimming times', 'headphones swimming', 'critical swim', 'swim', 'swimming', 'week workout']"

6,"I love these goggles so much, but when it comes to charging them the goggles won‚Äôt charge well. I‚Äôll put them on the charger and the red light comes on. I‚Äôve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light. I understand that the goggles are new and still working through updates and I really appreciate what this company has done for swimming!",4,Charger problems,"['n‚Äôt charge', 'goggles', 'light stays red', 'light', 'red light', 'love', 'charging', 'n‚Äôt', 'charge', 'charger']","['charging goggles', 'goggles light', 'charger red', 'problem goggles', 'goggles new', 'love goggles', 'charger connects', 'connects goggles', 'understand goggles', 'goggles guaranteed']"
7,I don‚Äôt understand their pricing but right now I don‚Äôt care because I like this app and my goggles so much. It was always so annoying to me to have to remember my labs.

9,"I was really disappointed to learn the collected data from the Form Goggles cannot be pushed to Garmin Connect. Form should take a look at how Zwift (for cycling) does it because it cannot be that hard!

UPDATE:
Response from Form: ‚ÄúUnfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.‚Äù

My Response:
First, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I‚Äôm sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin‚Äôs limitation? 

BTW, I‚Äôve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.",3,Doesn‚Äôt Push Data to Garmin Connect,"['Form Goggles', 'Garmin Connect', 'disappointed to learn', 'learn the collected', 'Garmin', 'Form', 'Goggles', 'pushed to Garmin', 'data', 'Zwift']","['garmin connect', 'data garmin', 'garmin', 'garmin limitation', 'garmin problem', 'garmin able', 'limitation garmin', 'connect form', 'pushed garmin', 'fine garmin']"
10,I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace,4,Really good googles and app,"['love the idea', 'rest timer', 'current lap timer', 'current lap', 'lap timer', 'lap', 'workout', 'timer', 'love', 'idea']","['lap timer', 'timer swim', 'timer awesome', 'swim settings', 'records laps', 'rest timer', 'current lap', 'timer', 'laps swims', 'laps']"
11,"Goggles/software do function well and as advertised. However, subscription price for workouts in addition to the high initial cost of buying their product is a slap in the face. Almost every other sport tracking wearable gives you the ability to integrate workouts with no extra cost. I will stick to manually performing workouts with the unsubscribed version until they break, then likely seek a different brand.",3,Subscription??,"['software do function', 'Goggles', 'software', 'advertised', 'workouts', 'high initial cost', 'function', 'subscription price', 'cost', 'high initial']","['goggles software', 'tracking wearable', 'goggles', 'sport tracking', 'integrate workouts', 'price workouts', 'wearable gives', 'software', 'workouts unsubscribed', 'wearable']"
12,If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form. Would be cool to see an estimated distance so I don‚Äôt have to do the math myself.,4,Open Water distance swim without GPS,"['calculates stroke rate', 'open water setting', 'estimate their DPS', 'stroke rate', 'calculate distance swam', 'setting without GPS', 'user can estimate', 'swam in open', 'open water', 'water setting']","['distance swam', 'distance stroke', 'swimming watch', 'gps form', 'estimated distance', 'dps distance', 'calculates stroke', 'calculate distance', 'gps', 'stroke rate']"
13,"I bought the goggles for the real-time telemetry.  The true potential was the workouts.  I stay engaged and improving without boredom.

14,"I have these googles and they are pretty neat.  I‚Äôm fortunate to be grandfathered in and the workouts features are nice.  I‚Äôm very disappointed that Form decided to move to a subscription model for any future users.  You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.

The subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.

See below the email I received from FORM.

If you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26. Real-time metrics in pool, open water, and swim spa are now part of the FORM membership.

16,"I have been using the goggles regularly for both pool and OW swims. Both with Apple Watch and Garmin connect as the goggles when used for OW simply function as a display while the Watch control the recording and swim.

1. Current pace not available, only average page for entire workout
2. HR displayed after pausing workout is wrong, both in FORM app and goggles. Heart rate shown is 20 BPM above actual rate and when examine using the FORM app the entire second half of the swim has HR increased by 20 BPM compared to first half.

In short totally unreliable data.

Furthermore this kind of errors are obvious software bugs and reveals that the goggles have not been tested properly when used for OW swims.

The only thing the goggles can be used for during OW swim is to display the total distance.",1,Unfinished product with serious shortcomings,"['Apple Watch', 'goggles regularly', 'goggles', 'FORM app', 'Watch control', 'Watch and Garmin', 'Watch', 'Garmin connect', 'swim', 'FORM']","['app goggles', 'goggles tested', 'goggles heart', 'swim hr', 'connect goggles', 'recording swim', 'apple watch', 'using goggles', 'watch garmin', 'goggles used']"
17,"Compared to regular swim googles these googles reduce your vision by about 50 percent. That‚Äôs a big trade off to have have data that is available, slightly delayed, from other sources like Apple Watch and and pool time clocks.

58,"I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn‚Äôt purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. 

My husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them! The open water functionality of the goggles by themselves is very basic. To get more detailed metrics you‚Äôll need to pair it with another device (Garmin, Polar, etc.). I don‚Äôt own any other devices because I don‚Äôt compete much and I‚Äôm not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. 

I‚Äôve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don‚Äôt own other devices, I‚Äôve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I‚Äôve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I‚Äôve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach‚Äôs mantra: ‚ÄúIf unsure, do more.‚Äù So I‚Äôd do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). 

Finally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It‚Äôs one thing to have a good turnover but if you‚Äôre just windmilling down the lane it‚Äôs no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. 

I would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I‚Äôm very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....ü§£",5,Great Training Tech,"['open water', 'open water functionality', 'open', 'water functionality', 'water', 'open water setting', 'Form goggles', 'goggles', 'n‚Äôt', '‚Äôve']","['swim pace', 'form goggles', 'functionality goggles', 'recommend goggles', 'goggles basic', 'goggles coach', 'stroke pace', 'long swims', 'goggles valuable', 'pace clocks']"
59,"Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.

All of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.

FORM‚Äôs only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ‚Ä¶.FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.

Bottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.",2,Does not sync to Apple Health,"['Apple Health', 'FORM', 'Motion and Fitness', 'Apple Health Active', 'Active Energy', 'Great goggles', 'Health Active Energy', 'Apple', 'Health', 'major sync issues']","['apple health', 'health active', 'fitness form', 'health update', 'exercise apps', 'active health', 'syncing form', 'swim data', 'health time', 'form swim']"
