It’s less expensive than others with plenty of workouts for all kinds of swimmers.

I think it would be great if it could be possible to set our own pace or just have more seconds since it’s for beginners.\\nHowever, still a great app and still 5 stars.', 'rating': 5, 'isEdited': False, 'title': 'Amazing app, some improvements needed', 'userName': 'Nicola9.4'} \n",

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to.

Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.\\n\\nThe app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. \\n\\nI wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.\", 'rating': 4, 'isEdited': False, 'userName': 'ENC iOS Reviews', 'title': 'Improved tracking but data analysis still weak'}\n"

However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.\\nP. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!', 'rating': 5, 'isEdited': True, 'userName': 'armanbn', 'title': 'Amazing! Now even better 😃'}\n"

       "'Got the app 5 weeks ago and I have made more progress in that time than the whole 1.5 years of swimming on my own before. The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative I’ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasn’t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I can’t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and I’d imagine it varies for everyone.---------I am not a competíos swimmer but I enjoy it and wanted to push myself. I have been using this app for almost 6 months and it has been great! It’s so worth the fee. It has helped me continue to improve my technique and swim faster (my top two goals). It gives you weeks long plans based on your goals (which you can adjust) and the times for each workout are based on your past swim times. You can also make each workout shorter or longer in duration based on your needs for that day. It also has a library of swimming workouts that you can do as you choose. They also have videos on tips for how to improve form and drills. It has helped me begin to learn a new stroke (I’m leaning breaststroke). I also like that they offer dry land workouts! They can be done at home with minimum equipment (or none in lost cases). I also love the option to chat with employees when I have questions. This can a question about a note in a workout or swimming tips. Since I’m not part of a team, it feels really good to have that human contact! The app is compatible with Apple and Garmin watches. If you have one, you get to see what’s next while in the water and or records your time and more. If you don’t have one of these (I didn’t at first), you can take note of four times and the add the manually.---------Very impressed.  As a long time swimmer with an Apple Watch, I didn’t think I wanted another app on top of Workout/Activities.  In fact I was initially annoyed that the app is designed for interval training not lap swimming.   I wanted notch up analytics for my laps at a slight cost, not a fully coached swim program.  But they’ve turned me around. From the moment my note to their customer service turned into a very rapid courteous personal reply, they began  winning me over.  Within 7 days I had begun to really appreciate feature sets and subscribed for a full year. Their app is loaded with pre-set and customizable workouts. You can for example remove kick drills from suggested workouts (my knee is injured) or checkout 15 second explanatory videos for stuff they want you to try. In short, a host of ways to make my swims more interesting.  I just finished a 1 on 1 call with their CS (currently offered to all subscribers) going over a few questions which they walked me through, noted my suggestions/concerns and patiently brought me into the world of their app.   I can understand why Apple gave them such high marks -  an very well designed product making use of Watch and phone tech , impressive CS, great GUI and what feels like an ever expanding future.  *****---------Let’s be honest, for many of us, our best competitive swimming years are behind us. Whether you’re a beginner, returning to the pool after taking years off, or in a master’s swim program - no doubt you need accountability, coaching, motivation and structure. Not only does this platform come with great pre-built swim plans and ability to build customized libraries - you get coaching through blogs and videos from swim experts. And if that weren’t enough, it connects you with a truly global swim community with some really awesome and humble people encouraging each other everyday. Using the watch in the water keeps you going and pushes you - better than your old coach yelling from the side of the pool! The stats and visuals are phenomenal. I’m amazed at how far I have progressed just following the pre-built plans. I have one paid app on my phone - it’s this one. But I don’t think of this as an app - because it isn’t. It is a complete support platform for people who swim. PS: tech will have issues from time to time - it’s the responsiveness of the team that matters. I’ve never had a tech issue that didn’t get resolved fully and ASAP.---------First and foremost SwimPro is a great app with features that are helpful and motivating for a dedicated swimmer. I like being able to account for kick and drill sets during practice on the app. The “workout of the day” feature is easy to use, but only after reading the instructions. It is not “on the go” intuitive. The app has lap counting glitches. First, it lags behind counting laps by 25-50 yards. It usually catches up. However, I got lulled into trusting SwimPro to accurately tally the yards in my workout and today it got stuck at 2100 yards no matter how much more I swam (3750 yds). The app integrates easily to Strava and the Apple health apps. However, it can result in double counts of calories burned on calorie counter apps. I use MyNetDiary.  The glitches can make one frustrated, but overall the app is headed in the right direction.---------This is the most complicated app for beginners. I literally didn’t even know what freestyle was. The plan assumes you have some sort of technical swimming background. Added to that is the fact that there is A LOT going on. So many colors and progress bars. I watched the videos a couple of times and still was confused. Added to that was the bug with the app not connecting with the watch and I had to reinstall.\\n\\nAlso, my pool is 25yd. The drill would say, for example, 2x100. Which I understood to be do 100 years twice. Then I had to calculate 100 is going back and forth 4 times. Then again. Can it just say 8x25? Or 4x25, 4x25? I feel like I had to do so much mental gymnastics and keep track of count. Again, Im sure there is a reason for it. But, the beginner plan was called “get wet”. I wanted to get in the water and do the drills. Enjoy myself swimming while I practice about breathing techniques. Master each stroke. Etc. \\n\\nAnyway, this is my take. This app is not for me. Maybe a super beginner plan with less technical stuff and a simplified screen would help. For now, I got my 20 dollars back. Im not paying to complicate working out. I just get a simple workout on swimplan and track on my apple watch.---------I use this app with my Apple watch 3. It automatically tracks all my lap swimming including what stroke I am doing. You have to input the kick sets yourself, but that is easily done. Seems to be very accurate, maybe off by 25 yards once in a while in a 3000 to 4000 yard workout. That’s not a big deal for me. \\nMy workouts automatically get uploaded to Strava. Call me vain, but that gets me to work out even harder!\\nI’ve used MySwimPro for open water three times. It definitely tracks the yardage and route. I thought there was a problem with it uploading my swim, but that’s only because my watch was in airplane mode. The Apple Watch goes into airplane mode when you switch your phone into that mode. But the watch doesn’t come out unless you take it out of airplane mode on the watch itself. This is totally unrelated to the MySwimPro app. \\nDefinitely sign up for emails; the weekly how-to and technique videos are really well done and helpful. \\nAll in all I highly recommend this app,  definitely better than just the Apple Watch software.---------High School was a long time ago for me, but I loved the swim team! My daughter has been swimming for high school too and I’ve always loved watching her! So when a gym with a pool opened up close by I signed up before they finished building it. The first month was killer, but I got my old strokes back and can now survive a good long 2,000 yard swim comfortably. For Christmas my wife got me an Apple Watch 4. To my amazement and delight, the basic watch can keep track of my distance AND my strokes! To my more amazement and delight I came across MySwimPro which works seamlessly with my watch! I’ve done a few workouts and through MySwimPro I’ve realized things have drastically changed since 1987! It’s like learning to swim all over again and I love it! Since I’ve started using MySwimPro I am within 5 seconds of my fastest 50 free in high school! Can’t wait to beat it and my school IM and Breaststroke records as well! And this is at age 50! Here’s to swimming and my personal MySwimPro coach! One of the best investments I’ve ever made for myself! You’ll love it too!!---------I’ve been using MSP for about 4 months, swimming 3 times per week usually.   The training plans are excellent.  Having the workouts loaded on my Apple Watch so the watch can keep track of intervals is really helpful.   Using the app has helped my swimming a lot.  That said, I’ve encountered a few bugs.  There have been issues with dynamic interval times that I’ve entered being overwritten.  Other users have experienced the same.  When this occurs it messes up the workout on my watch. I’ve been in touch with support but the issue still hasn’t been resolved after about a month.  I’ve also had issues loading training plan workouts onto my watch if I modify them.  It takes several tries for the modifications to show up on the watch for some reason.  Some of the workouts have links to videos that only work intermittently.   I still use the app every time I swim and I still find it helpful, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get it working properly.---------Save your money if you use a different watch.\\nGot the trial. Super excited to not have to create my own workouts in Garmin Connect. I have used my Garmin for Pool Swimming and had no trouble with structure workouts or my watch tracking laps/yardage. Thought the training plans looked fantastic and couldn’t wait to try them out. Turns out it doesn’t share a workout file like Training Peaks. Instead you need to down an app on the watch. Did it, syncing was laborious, the swim app for my Garmin watch was terrible. Yardage the watch counted was not even reasonable. The data the app offered after the workout had synced with my phone was garbage. Wrong yardage, wrong strokes identified, intervals made no sense. Without the ability to send my workout to my watch and find it useable the app and matching subscription is worthless. Liked the idea. Wished it lived up to the promise, but I’ve canceled my subscription and let the free trial run out.---------I am a 55 year old former college swimmer who had been out of the water for over 30 years.  I was too intimidated to try Masters in my seriously out of shape body.  I found this app by searching the App Store.  I loved the workouts and that I could set my skill level.  I loved the technique/drill videos as I had forgotten a lot of those.  \\nI quickly went premium.  I got up the nerve to join Masters only to have the coordinator move away several months later.  So there is no Masters program near me now.  Not to worry, because I have the app!  I stick mainly to the Workout of the Day but there are workouts for each stroke and an IM workout and kicking workouts.  \\nI took my phone in a ziplock bag to the pool deck and followed the workout that way.  Last Christmas I bought the Apple Watch and I now can look at my wrist and follow the workout.  It’s a win, win, win!!!!---------I loved the idea of this app and really wanted to like it. The workout structure was helpful and is pretty nice. However, I found numerous glitches in the app where it would tell you do to a specific type of stroke… but wouldn’t tell you how to do it. I would update my app and eventually had to contact support. That was a mixed bag. They also never issued refunds. That’s in the fine print but I didn’t think they were very upfront with that. So buyer beware. I found that very frustrating because I constantly had issues with the app and they’d say they’re working on it. I eventually gave up because it was super expensive and never worked. \\n\\nHonestly, I wish I would have used the Total Immersion Program with Terry Laughlin (may he Rest In Peace). It does a much better job of explaining the technique and Terry is a much better instructor. There are dvds and a book but the website is great too.---------I love this app and have used it to set and log my swim workouts for the past few months since purchasing my first Apple Watch.  BUT, I was caught off guard this past Saturday when I went for my morning swim.  I selected my desired workout (one I programmed myself), and started swimming, the app did not appear to be logging any information other than showing a timer that was counting up.  Found out later that the developer pushed out an update to the app after my last swim and it apparently made my copy of the app go wonky.  I uninstalled the app from my watch and the phone, then reinstalled it both places and it seems to be working now.  But it made for a very frustrating swim workout that Saturday morning. Guess it shows how much I rely on it for my workouts.---------It’s like I’m learning how to swim again. I’m a mom so I hardly ever get time to myself, but the pool is a great way to exercise and have that time while my boys play in the backyard! \\n\\nI grew up swimming every day, I’ve always been faster and more advanced swimmer than most people, even as a child. Since having kids, my core and my swim time is awful, of course. I can barely hold my breath like I used to! My lungs and muscles and core are not used to it anymore. So I’m really putting this app to work and trying to focus on one goal at a time to master. I’m loving it. \\n\\nI can’t wait to see what goals I hit from now til winter! And I love that you can use GPS for free open water swim or put in how long your pool is. I also can’t wait to do this at the beach!---------I loved this app, but for the last week or more I’ve spent at least an hour a day installing an uninstalling it thinking that it’s finally fixed!  Then the next day I get ready to swim only to find that its not working again!  I’m so upset because I swim 3 to 4 days a week and when u get n the pool and r ready to start the last thing u want is to start the app and it’s not working again.  I live n Florida and many days I have to swim n between storms not to mention the schedule that I keep.  \\nPlease respond and help me with my problem.  I have the latest update an Apple Watch 2 that’s still covered by Apple care, but since this isn’t an Apple app probably can’t be helpful.  Also have an iPhone 8 also still covered.  I’m adding to my review has anyone noticed that there isn’t a good review since June.  What has happened to this app?  When the good reviews r about customer service that’s know help!  Please undo what u did and fix this app.  People gave u five star review a year ago.  Remember if it’s not broken why do u have to mess with it!---------I am at 67 a new swimmer . I cannot begin to explain the benefit that this app and the outstanding customer support has bestowed to me. I started out needing to rest after 25 meters . Going to the pool to swim was a source of anxiety and I went because I knew it was in my best interest. Enter My Swim Pro and I became mesmerized by the enthusiasm of Fares the founder . I wanted to become a swimmer . With the aid of Charles the “smartwatch whisperer “ suddenly I had a coach and a plan . I am know a swimmer , not a great swimmer but with the aid of this program suddenly I am treated and feel like an athlete in training . You want to just swim go ahead and enjoy but if you want to improve and become engaged in a fun healthy sport ? Stop wasting your time sign up and join all of us at MySeimPro community . Go ahead , I dare you !---------I just recently renewed my paid subscription. It has been worth every penny.\\n\\nI have loved to swim my entire life, however, as an adult I would often find myself getting bored / burnt out / unchallenged, picking it up here and there when I felt like it.\\n\\nI bought this app last year and have done at least 3 swims a week - a consistency I haven\\'t managed since I swam competitively in my teens. I just completed the 12 Week Open Water training plan, and I hope to do the IMx plan soon. The daily workouts are also fun.\\n\\nThis app has a huge library of drill videos and often posts about how to improve in different areas and / or strokes. But most importantly, it keeps swimming interesting and challenging, whether you are a beginner or advanced. It has really renewed my love for the sport, and I\\'ve gone from doing boring 1000 yard workouts to 3500 yard workouts over the past year. \\n\\nCustomer service is EXCELLENT - though I\\'ve never actually had a problem with it bug-wise. After buying the app, the creator took the time to speak to me and get feedback on how to improve it. \\n\\nHighly recommend spending the cash on the paid version of this. It\\'s the best app on my phone!---------So this app is amazing when it works well, but it is beyond frustrating when it doesn’t work. It randomly shuts down in the middle of a workout or freezes and you lose everything. Without a hard copy of your workout, you’re left trying to remember what you were going to do and the intervals. You also don’t get credit for what you already swam, and personally I like the satisfaction of knowing when a job is done well and what my stats from the workout are. I paid for a year subscription, and on days like today I feel as though it was a waste. Yes, the app is apparently updated. My watch and phone are as well.  \\n\\nAside from the negativity, the workouts of the day are wonderful for saving and doing when you want to swim without coming up with your plan. I was doing a training regimen before covid, and that was a great way to push yourself. It is the best app for swimming when it works, but it’s the worst when it doesn’t function properly.---------I used this app with my Apple Watch Series 4 and now with the Ultra. Even with the new IOS and updated version of the app, it still does not track my laps accurately. I have my own pool in my backyard and know the distance so it’s not that I’m possibly entering the wrong length of the pool. I can say in their defenses that Apple fitness doesn’t track accurately either. The only app that tracks accurately, though not all the time, is My Swim Tracker. I’m not concerned about all complaining I read here about the nagging for upgrades and costs. It won’t even count a lap accurately. By the way, it is consistently 6 laps off. I have reset the calibration on my phone for the watch and still no success. I have reset the phone and app with no change. I have even deleted and reinstalled the app and nothing seems to work to get this app to accurately track my swims. What gives??---------The MySwimPro app is falsely advertised as a free product with in-app purchases available. \\n\\nThe fact is that the free app offers nothing that the Apple Watch fitness app doesn’t already do. \\n\\nThe features that MySwimPro have over the fitness app is locked behind a $180 annual paywall. \\n\\nWithout the $180 purchase, the app does NOT: \\n\\n- allow custom or community workouts of any kind.\\n- track detailed swim times\\n- provide real time intervals on your watch during a generic swim\\n\\nWhat does the free version do? \\n\\n- has a generic swim display that shows Total time, Total distance, and heart rate. (No intervals, splits, finish times, etc). It’s the same as the free Apple Watch fitness app, with different color lettering. \\n\\nAdditionally, the phone app cannot be used without the $180 purchase. It puts a giant ad on your screen that takes up 50% of the display. With the added top and bottom control banners, the free app only has about 20% of screen available to you to use. \\n\\nThis app is despicable. The people behind this app are despicable. I’ve always thought highly of my fellow competitive swimmers. The people behind this app have brought some reality to my naive and biased belief. \\n\\nThey are simply taking advantage of older, out of shape, non-competitive swimmers who wouldn’t know any better. \\n\\nSave your $180. Google swim workouts, print, and bring to the pool deck.---------I want to commend this app and all of the people behind it. I use this app more than anything on my phone. The workouts are challenging and the compatibility to my watch is unparalleled. I am working on the 10k training program and I am loving the workouts. \\n\\nMy only criticism is in the apps interpretation of my speed. For some interval sets the pace is a bit too ambitious for me. It’s a petty criticism since I can go into the workout to adjust the time. I use the Hal Higden running app and find that the apps ability to adjust suggested paces based on previous workouts to be a really great addition.  Again, MySwimPro is worth every penny. It’s a great app and you can tell the people behind it are passionate and ambitious about swimming and this app!---------UPDATE:\\n\\nI have been using this app for maybe 4 months or so, and I love it even more now than when I first started with it!!\\n\\nApp developer VERY responsive, and they release positive app updates frequently without ruining the app. Just keeps getting better and better, and for REAL!\\n\\nThe premium subscription is SO worth it - you get a LOT for your money.\\n\\nThe community on Facebook is great as well - VERY positive, VERY encouraging to other swimmers, REGARDLESS of ability. \\n\\nLove this app, and it should be app of THE YEAR, not just the day!!!\\n\\nI have completely immersed myself into ALL of the swim tracking apps - lots of time doing it - and this BY FAR is the best, by a mile - SO psyched about it. \\n\\nAll of the other apps just try to track a workout, but this app has an INCREDIBLE library of pre-made workouts (app subscription required), and it is AMAZING, and has taken my swimming to a completely different level!\\n\\nI have hired swim coaches in the past, and this app blows them all away. Very intuitive, accurate, and a very vibrant community, AND, IT WORKS!!!!\\n\\nThe customer support from the developer is unbelievable - seriously good!!\\n\\nI use an Apple Watch Series 3 for reference.---------I am not a professional swimmer but I do swim 6 days a week as my primary exercise. I used the one month free trial to get some of the premium features and I wasn’t sold. \\n\\nI like that there are workouts designed for me and that the watch tells you what to do. I used to print my workout and tape it to my water bottle at the end of the lane. I like that there are videos and helpful hints along the way when learning a new technique. \\n\\nI’m not a fan of the fact that I could finish a 1600yd workout just in time for the app the crash at the end of the workout and not record anything on the app. \\n\\nI would like to be able to restart a set or a rep in case the times didn’t match up or in case the app was buggy (which has happened). \\n\\nI have been so excited to see the times for reps and splits when I pop up out of the water only to find that it seems like the timer never started. Except it did start. And while I was trying to decide how to unlock, force touch pause, then force touch resume to see my times, I got a haptic notification that meant my next rep was starting and now I’m behind. \\n\\nI definitely wouldn’t pay for the app especially if the crashes so often. Even when I had the premium free trial it crashed. It needs some major bug fixes before I’ll try it out again.---------I’ve waited a year to write this review. MSP was decent initially in the pool, but not open water swims. The team has thoughtfully and methodically improved the open water performance over the last year. The most recent update finally gets rid of the data anomalies - jagged lines - and inaccurate readings (was about 20% high on distance). I believe the distance now reads about 10% low, based on the garmin device that my swim partner uses that is quite accurate. I’ll give this app 5 stars when that gets fixed and when it can automatically detect pauses/breaks in open water swimming (now it pops up a dialog asking if I’ve stopped swimming or am doing drills, which doesn’t account for taking a break).---------Keeping in mind the ridiculous hobbling that apple water lock causes, this app is still horrible. It undercounted a simple 300 free warmup. You have to screw around with trying to lunlick the water lock and then restart to go to the next set, which is a disaster. It somehow decided to pause a quarter of the way into my 16 repeat set. When you restart you have no idea what your set is so you waste the fort interval. You have no list of what’s next. All in all it captured almost none of my work out and I gave up on it eventually. To add insult to a bad experience the only thing it reported was my interval times. Yea that does a lot of good to know what interval I did. You don’t get your active time or stoke count without subscribing. You get both of those for free in the native apple activity app. An entire wasted workout of data. Glad I know not to spend money unless I just want workout ideas. This app is a huge fail.---------This is THE app if you’re looking for something ton seamlessly track your swims and sync with your wearable tech. The swim workouts are varied enough there’s something for everyone. You can customize all the workouts, change the interval times, set number, order of the workout, anything and everything. That’s a great feature because sometimes I don’t have as much time as I need for some of the workouts. Problem solved. \\n\\nI recently had an issue with my account and the customer service was on point. I got an immediate response and my issue was resolved with that one response. Keep up the great work, MySwimPro!---------Every time I open the app (about once every two days) they make me close a pop up about new features/upgrades/bug fixes. Good for you all for being so active at work, but shoving a bunch of text I don’t care about in my face literally every time I open the app is immensely annoying. Hire a UX researcher to investigate if you think I’m being dramatic, or, if you already have a UXR, perhaps listen to them more, as I’m certain they’re telling you it’s bad practice. \\n\\nAnyways, app is fine. Better tracking than Strava for swimming. Rarely gets my stroke right for pool swimming and I often have to adjust the distances for open water (always severely undercounted distance). But better than other options for now.---------Buggy.  Poor split recording.   Switched from yards to meters And nothing happened to base times.   Occasionally will skip a workout in a series and there is no way to go back.  Frequently displays single workout results twice with slightly different times and splits.  No great way to edit this.\\n\\nUnfavorable characteristics:\\nIf I finish after the base time, the program has already started the next .  There doesn’t appear to be anyway to record this.  I can pause the workout but that’s not what really happened.  I can’t change my bases on the fly, and go back later, look at what I was able to do and change bases for the next workout.   It would be nice if the program would take tsplits into account when using designed workouts.  Can’t just extend a program workout if I want to do a few more meters---------This app is amazing and the customer service is awesome! I had been a swimmer growing up and always had access to a coach. But after becoming an adult, I no longer had a coach and I stopped swimming. Every time I tried again to get back in the pool, I never knew what to swim, and it I wasn’t making any progress. I was hesitant at first to use an app to swim, but After starting MySwimPro I can never go back to just swimming. I’ve lost more weight than I thought I could, I’m swimming faster now than when I was a kid and I feel like I’m apart of a community. This app really changed my life for the better.---------I’m really impressed with the app. I downloaded it in January, when I returned to the pool after 20 years off, following a running injury. Pools in the area were closed March-July, but I’ve been back for about a month, and I still love the app. You can create your own workout if you want, but there are also hundreds already written workouts to choose from. I send a workout to my Apple Watch and then jump in and swim. The watch communicates with my phone and I get “credit” from Strava for the workout. Even after 50+ workouts, I’m never bored. I’ve used the app for general strength building, too, through the dry land exercises. It’s expensive, but very worth it!---------While the app itself is amazing between the video demos, training options, workouts, and tracking available, the customer service is what has made me come and place this review. I love that I can use my Apple Watch and transfer the data to my app. I knew it had transferred and saw it there the night prior. The next morning it was gone.  I sent an email, and within hours had received feedback, and was assisted in trying to retrieve the data. Sometimes it is out of our hands, but the fact that they were responsive and there to help not knowing whether I was going to get my data back or not was HUGE to me!---------App subscription seems overall expensive. But i can see that it costs money to make the nice instruction videos. But paying extra for metrics seems a bit much.  My biggest gripe is that even with a series 4 watch the app doesn’t accurately gather the distance information, thus doesn’t appropriately capture the rep transitions and counts. Sometimes it seems to show the correct yardage but then when I end the workout it takes off 25 yard. I start and stop in the same place in a 25 yard pool, so not possible to not be in 50 yard increments. Sometimes I’ll do extra laps and it subtracts it off the total in the end, not giving me credit. \\n\\nI like the idea, and maybe I need to learn better how it expects to be used but it shouldn’t be that complicated.---------I really do like this app. I love that it gives analytics on distance per stroke. I wear an Apple\\nWatch and use the app for my own work outs and open water swims. I am also not able to see well without my glasses. I like that I can make out most of the options in this app on my watch without them.  My only Dislike is that it does not recognize a kick set when you are only in pool swim mode. So I always have to Go in and manually add those as part of my workout. I also wish it would stop on a pause automatically as it is not easy to pause mid workout of time is your goal. Other than that I like the app and will keep using it. I’m happy to have a swim app.---------I’m sad to say this app is no longer worth it. I enjoyed their workouts and the fitbit app is actually pretty good when you load the workouts to the app, however as soon as Fitbit announced a partnership with Myswimpro, they changed their pricing structure and also removed EVERY SINGLE FREE WORKOUT. You can no longer use the app unless you pay them money. This even goes against fitbits own workout app, which does provide some free workouts amongst the paid. It’s sad the developers got greedy and are now forcing people to pay for all items in the app. The ability to at least list a few free workouts was great, but now unless you make your own workout you can’t sync anything up to the fitbit app unless you subscribe to their plans. I’d even pay for the app itself if it didn’t mean some subscription. but unfortunately that’s what this app has come to.---------I am in my late 50s, was a swimmer in HS and college and really came back to the sport because I needed low impact on my knees. I have loved this app for almost 3 yrs. \\nI applaud MSP with developing the Dryland exercises but not until the Low Impact Training Plan did I get engaged in a routine. I love that I can control the timing as well as having Fares right there demonstrating and doing the exercise with me. What a way to keep us motivated and not feeling like we are losing out on our memberships!  I hope you will keep these plans available once we are back in the swim. \\nGo MSP Team!---------I really like this app, but I really only do two workouts at the pool. I rotate back and forth between a sprint workout and a distance workout. All I want is something to track those two. I can\\'t create and save those workouts any more without paying for premium.\\n\\nFor nearly $200 a year, I just can\\'t justify that. Comparable apps like Runkeeper and LoseIt have a free tier with solid basic functionality and even at premium tier they only charge $40 a year. MySwimPro seems to be trying to capitalize on having a near monopoly on the swimming app market. I\\'m going to the basic Apple Watch app instead until MySwimPro\\'s pricing is more in line with market rates.---------As others have stated there are technical issues with this app, most noticeably when you change things (yd to m, skip workout, add a set, etc).  The app is limited without a subscription, but the instructional videos are good.  I like the ability to define workouts but even that is limited if you’re not subscribed.\\n\\nHowever, even with a subscription (which I paid for several months) the app still limits what you can do. For example you can only have one active workout plan. Well what if I want to alternate sprint and distance workouts throughout the week?  No can do.\\n\\nBut even if none of these issues and limitations existed I can’t get over the ludicrous subscription price.  The developers should go look at popular apps that provide tremendous value for non-subscribers (MapMyX comes to mind).  There are many services for which I pay half the cost for something which my entire family gets to use (movie and music streaming come to mind).  It’s impossible for me to pay the effective cost of another gym membership for an app only I can use for maybe 6h/week.\\n\\nI knocked the rating down another star for the punitive subscription model.---------For the cost of this app I didn’t expect the features to be so limited. Also, it takes forever (and sometimes  multiple attempts) to log a workout. But even more important, the workout program I was using (400IMX challenge) actually made me lose ground in my 400 IM training. My fly endurance decreased and my baseline 100 IM time got slower! There was zero explanation of the intensity levels or some of the drills. When I searched the internet for the intensity levels, it seems that the program is using “best average” pace with intervals that don’t provide nearly enough rest. Also the workouts don’t contain enough kicking. No wonder my progress went in the wrong direction. I only used it for four of the 10 weeks—a very expensive experiment. I sure hope it doesn’t automatically renew 11 months from now.---------I went to the pool today and planned on using my watch and Swim Pro! Nope, I was greeted with tiny print telling me, nah, this app requires me to get permission! I’m sitting with my legs in the water and ready to start laps and no the app is NOT going to track my laps. And it didn’t. Useless! I paid for an app for swimming and it refused to work. If I can’t use it; what did I pay for? Now it’s my job to figure out how to use this? If the app requires me to figure out how to use it BEFORE I get in the pool it ought to tell me while I have glasses on and not goggles. I’m disappointed and actually angry. I pay to swim and paid for an app. Useless!\\nI have been to the pool 3 times with this app. Nothing works. Garbage. \\nThere needs to be instructions on setting it up and using it. Instead, it wants to sell upgrades. I hate it!---------When I signed up and filled in my profile info there was a workout.  Paid my subscription fee and went to pool. When I opened app there was a confusing amount of info and the workout included dryland etc. My profile did not include dryland, and it did include my available workout time.   The workout I saw before subscription was good. After I paid … totally different and I’m not able to stop and fiddle on my phone in the bright sun.  I can’t read without my glasses so I’d have to print everything… this is for young people with apple watches… or anyone with an Apple Watch… but not for 50 something’s trying to get in shape and have some workouts that you don’t have to make up yourself.  Very disappointed and wishing I didn’t spend money on this nonsense.---------I totally recommend this app to people learning to get better at swimming or get good workouts in the pool. However, I want to ask the developers if they could add more videos to most (those that aren’t easy described) workouts and reps. For example, it asks me to do a “heel tag breaststroke kick”, or a “flow kick.” Like, what is that? Could you add more description or a small video? If more clarification could be made on each, I would totally make this a 5/5. But please get the app, its great. Just wanted to ask the developers to improve this small part.---------Used the app with my Garmin Fenix 5S pro today for the first time. Already seeing the bugs that previous reviewers have mentioned. Even though my settings across Garmin, this app, and my watch are all set to yards and miles, it kept switching back-and-forth between meters and yards and then it was short changing me on the yards. It crashed five times before I got it to work properly. The first five times I tried using the work out that was uploaded to my watch, it was not the work out that was on my phone in the app and it would crash. I like the idea of workouts but this is going to drive me nuts and not sure I’m willing to pay for something that doesn’t work properly.---------This isn’t really a critique it’s more me asking if a feature could be added. I’m currently training my surfing and I need an app that can train my paddling and record distances, etc.. There are surf apps for tracking but those are mostly for surfing not training the paddling endurance. I was wondering if paddling could be added to the type since I’m sure it could be tracked as if it was free styling. Everything about the app would work with it, I’m planning on testing it out with free style stroke and see if it works well. \\n\\nThank you.---------Getting back in the water after being out for two years because of surgery and Covid. Right now I am using the app as a structured way to stay focused and not get overwhelmed from the thousands of yards to train. So far it has really helped in slowly getting back into the groove of everything. Utilizing The Apple Watch has been a great way to see and track heart rate during the work out as well as yardage and the intervals to stay focused on what’s in front of me and not what’s to come.---------My very first time using it I swam 1600 yards in open water. I went to stop my workout and save it but it wouldn’t let me. The time showed 20 minutes but after changing out of my wetsuit I checked to see if I could try and save my workout and it was now showing 2600 yards but still 20 minutes. Every time I tried to save my swim it would give me an error. Nothing would work. It then drained my battery so fast that my battery didn’t even last half the day when usually I can go two full days before battery dying. It must have been stuck and still using GPS functions and killed the battery. I was very hopeful for this app as it was supposed to sync with Strava. I guess now I will just wait and hope that Strava comes out with a swim workout feature on the Apple Watch soon.---------I began training and racing in triathlons last year. Previously I had been a college rugby player with very very little swimming experience. Using the MySwim app has helped me so much. The main thing has been the ease and convenience that comes with using it on my apple watch. Prior to using the app on my watch I was struggling to improve on my swim, all I had was a Nixon surf watch that I used as a stop watch. Now I can measure my length speed, work in drills, and reps all on the watch app, then I can go look up stats on the mobile app. I love this app and will continue to use it in the future.---------When I first download the app they had an update, and none of the tutorials videos works. Upon contacting customer support they were more than helpful and provided working links to all the video within a timely manner. In addition, you can download all the swim workout as a pdf and print it out. However, It a bit of a bum but understandable that the garmin sync for easy workout transfer doesn’t work. However I was surprised they even offered the feature they also have it for Fitbit and Apple Watch.---------I have been using My Swim Pro for about two months and I am truly amazed at the ability of the app to create bespoke training plans for me.   Time seems to fly by now in the pool.  My technique and fitness are very clearly improving and I am enjoying the global MSP community tremendously.   I have contacted the support team with questions twice and had immediate responses and quick solutions.  This is such an incredible deal for what truly feels like one on one coaching and support.  Thank you SO much My Swim Pro!---------when you open the app, it presents all this cool stuff, like workouts, videos, but absolutely none of it is included in the free version. this is what other reviewers are commenting on, and the developers don’t seem to get that. the effect is that the free version feels like little more than an advertisement for the $30/month paid version.\\n\\nlet’s take the workouts, for example. you can save custom workouts, great! but where are you going to get these custom workouts? for a casual user like me, i can get all kinds of dry land workouts from the nike app—which is genuinely free and excellent. i can get pool workouts on the internet. if this app would include even one beginner and one intermediate app in the free version, it would have some value for casual fitness swimmers. i’d even pay $5/month for a modest selection of workouts and videos. i don’t need coaching support or video feedback. i just want to swim better, not necessarily faster.\\n\\ntl;dr. this app is only for swimmers who are primarily concerned with lap times and who don’t have a team and are willing to pay for a pretty expensive app.---------I’ve been using the app for over two years and love the app, the coaching, and the people behind the app. I have dropped significant time across all strokes and with that confidence I’ve been competing over the last couple of years. It’s a coach on my watch. \\n\\nThe latest innovation around test sets will push you to your limits and i love it! It pushes me way outside of my comfort zone and gives me motivation to improve. \\n\\nNo matter what level of swimmer you are, this app can help you!---------This is one of the few applications that totally enhance your workouts, and that I cannot live without. I was not great at creating my own workouts, and after swimming competitively in high school, was missing the structure that a coach would provide in a season. This app’s workout structure is varied, purposeful, and expertly crafted - couldn’t ask for better. Also, in general, one of the best UI/UX designs in a fitness app I’ve ever used. If you swim or previously swam competitively in high school/college, get this app.---------I’m done with this app. Don’t get me wrong this app is great and I’ve loved using it as I’ve gotten back into swimming. However somehow I got logged out of my account and couldn’t remember the password I used when I first set up the app. I’ve requested several password resets over the course of a week and have not received one in my inbox, spam, or junk folders. I’ve reached out to MySwimPro through their support site and social media and have heard nothing. From this experience it’s evident to me that this team could care less about their customers and is more concerned with getting your money and funding than helping current users with issues. Oh well at least I can save $100 a year now when I cancel my subscription because I can’t even use the app anymore.---------First off I’m just starting off swimming and have used the app once with my watch and it seems to have done what I was hoping it would do.  I’m not a sophisticated swimmer so I can’t comment on all the analytics etc. \\n\\nMy frustration is with being billed for a yearly subscription.  There are 15 different subscription options all different, I thought when I downloaded the app that I would have 7 days to try it and then would go month to month.  Instead I wake up to a one year bill and a note from Apple saying I can’t change my subscription. \\n\\nWell you have me know and I will use the product but 15 different subscription options seems deceptive and overly complicated.---------Meh. It’s ok. Downloaded it for the drill/kick set mode. That part is fine. I saw there was a custom workout feature that let you program in your workouts. Disaster. Requires constant messing around with my watch to move to the next set. Also thought the option to program a dry land workout was nice except it only lets you choose from a library of pre determined movements AND a simple pull up isn’t one of them (along with a lot of other basic, common movements). Lots of great potential here but a lot to be desired…maybe in time it’ll improve. At least I didn’t spend money on it.---------Recently got a series 3 AppleWatch and was looking for a good swim workout app. Most of the reviews were positive for MSP so I thought I’d give it a shot. Prior to the recent update it was great, I’m not a pro swimmer so the basic features do just fine. Love that it posts to Strava & I have the ability to share on social media (I’ve got support people around the country that like to see my progress). Now with the 07/22 update the app doesn’t recognize my strokes or distance and often asks me if I am still swimming. I cleared the cache on my phone & watch, restarted the watch and it still doesn’t work right. I would have given it a higher mark because I like the app but it is now broken & virtually unusable to me...---------Having some problems with the app recording my pool sets, I reached out to Myswimpro and Charlie Brown replied. We were able to set up a WebCam meeting where Charlie successfully diagnosed the problems, walked me through the fix and everything works now as it should. I highly recommend the app and Charlie was both professional, friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend this product and the company. Great product and great customer service, five stars.---------I had just started swimming again after not swimming for years and had recently became a lifeguard (again). I wanted to swim faster than my coworkers but just general fitness in general, so I took it upon myself for one of their annual sales for a year. Did it. I even had problems with the dry land part of the app syncing to my watch, CS (customer support) was more than happy to help with everything. All of you working on this app are awesome and thank you!---------Decided to use this app for the first time to go for the world swim day event. It did not sync with the apple activity app so none of my previous workout showed up. I then started a new workout in the MySwimPro Watch app on my AW2. From the start it was good. Laps got recorded. Approaching the end of my 1 mile swim, I wanted to check how I went and how much I got left, turned my wrist and found the app spinning. Stopped and waited for it to load and only to find that eventually NOTHING got recorded!!! I was outrageous. Such bad UX. Why not just let people use the Apple activity app to log?! Now my activity app also did not log anything. Because this app blocks it to do so. Really upset and probably won’t use again for something I even need to pay to use.---------I’ve been using this app for the last two years and it’s been largely good.  Mostly right about what stroke I’m swimming (though it doesn’t understand what I think of as Breaststroke), decent on splits and intervals, ok on open water (sometimes doesn’t accurately measure a short open water course I frequently swim).  Recently improved to recognize kicking.\\n\\nYesterday and today however it fails to recognize my distances.  No that wasn’t 20x25@:40, I swam a 500 warmup.  All sets, all intervals are now 25’s. I thought one workout was anomaly, but it’s now 2 in a row.  I actually downloaded bug fixes between the two workouts.  Please fix this!---------I took me a really long time to just log a swim workout just now and every time I clicked “save” to add a set, pops up their ad to subscribe monthly or annually, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I understand that there’s bugs and trying to fix that with even more updates, but I liked the old versions better. It’s not a one star because of the personalization and it’s awesome for that aspect, but for someone who already swims in a masters team and would like an app that can simply log a workout that has different features (equipment, intervals, effort), this app is starting to be way too much for me and I don’t like how it’s not streamline.---------So far I like the app. There are a few issues I have with it. One is that you have to have the membership to do any of the dry land workouts. Another is all the ads for the membership (most apps do that and I get why but it is still bothersome). I will definitely use this app but am disappointed that I have to look for land workouts elsewhere when it seemed like I was going to have both land and water workouts in the same place.---------As the title suggests, in theory, this would be an awesome app. However, I can’t tell you how many times this program raised my stress levels before I even started a workout.\\n\\nI’m working with the “Couch to 1K” training program and more often than not, it incorrectly selects the wrong “next workout in the plan.” Also, often times a workout comes up and when I start it, it immediately ends. With the integration with Strava, I have all these workouts of 0s which of course, I waste time deleting. Similarly wasted time deleting them from the Activity app.\\n\\nAlso, even though my workout preferences are set to meters, my workouts show up in yards. So instead of an 800 m workout, it gets synced with Strava as 754m.\\n\\nThen there’s the cost. $160 a year is a lot for such a big-ridden program.---------Up until this summer, I was able to create a simple workout and that was good for me - I know my times, I’m not looking to win medals or meets, but just wanted something that tracks workouts and tells me when to push off the wall. Now I can’t even edit the workouts I had before the latest update and literally everything  is behind a $180/yr paywall. It’s unfortunate, really, because it was the best out there, but the new interface is a step in the wrong direction and the cost is unreasonable. Even if they’d have offered an inexpensive option to just make your own workouts, I could be on board, but this isn’t worth the hassle.---------UPDATE #2: Well I guess I’ll leave at 1star. Read below if you want to read my rant. So far only 2 of 3 swims have recorded any heart rate. Tech support hasn’t responded again. Just doesn’t work. Save your money and just use Apple health. Never used coaching or other addon apps so don’t know if those work. \\n\\nUPDATE: Tech support came through with some steps to try. If all works as expected I will change my rating.\\n\\nAfter using this app for 6mo, I purchased the analytics add-on for $60. Now my heart rate does not show. It does show in My Health, an apple program. \\n\\nSupports response was of course send me screen shots and ridiculously asking what devices I was using. My Health? Must be Microsoft...\\n\\nThen I had to contact support (no contact initiated by them). Their response was of course to send more data. What a surprise! “Bring me a rock. No not that rock”. No contact again from support after 24 hrs. Next we’ll see who they try to blame.\\n\\nNow I’ve paid hard earned dollars for an app that stopped functioning as soon as they got my $$. \\n\\nDON’T waste your time or money. Try other apps.---------After using for approx 3 months, 2-3 times a week I have to say, I am not happy. Around 40-45 minutes into any workout, randomly the watch app closes. And it’s not every time. Most recently I was in the middle of an 800yd set, which was the last one of the main workout I designed. When I hit the wall to check time, it was just Blank. Which means it didn’t record over to Strava or my health app on Apple. Overall I like it, which is why it got 3. But it is very frustrating to find the app closed after a workout is not quite done.---------I got this app because it looked like the perfect thing to help me keep track of complex structured workouts as I train for my first 70.3. Unfortunately it was more harm than help.\\n\\n* The phone app constantly, constantly nags for a subscription when you’re inputting custom workouts\\n* It often looks like things you input aren’t saving and other times it just doesn’t save them.\\n* The watch — unlike every other app — starts your workout paused\\n* It doesn’t track your swims by distance, but by time, so if you don’t know your precise swim speeds, tracking is way off\\n* Without an interval set it forces you to unlock, swipe and tap “next set” in between every lap.\\n* Tapping “next set” re-locks the watch, but only sometimes.\\n\\nI need a really, really good swim tracking app, and I’d be willing to pay for it (maybe not subscribe, but I’d pay). Workout content is second. This app gets it backwards and it’s been on the market long enough to suggest that won’t change.---------This is a fantastic app idea that I want to work so badly.  Unfortunately, the number of technical issues keep it from being entirely useful.\\n\\nThe app fails to properly transfer data between the watch and the phone so workouts are lost.\\n\\nOccasionally, the premium subscription is lost and you have to navigate through a deep menu hierarchy to restore your purchase.\\n\\nThe app doesn’t accurately record lap times.\\n\\nI have to remember to open a workout on my phone and then open the app on my watch to load a workout, if I do this in the wrong order then I can’t get to the workout I want to do.\\n\\nFor the longest time, it recorded double workouts, but that seems to be fixed now.\\n\\nAgain, it’s just too many technical issues to be something I can strongly recommend.---------I couldn’t tell what I was supposed to do because it was too confusing. I paid for the full membership around 7 months ago, and I’m supposed to have quarterly 1:1 with a coach to help me, but aside from the first meet (which I didn’t know was video chat with the owner, my “coach” and some other guy), I’ve not received any kind of contact since. And honestly, I’ve not really used the app since either because every time I open it I’m just confused. There’s way too much information and since it’s not beginner friendly, it’s super overwhelming. I genuinely wish I hadn’t paid for it, but I definitely cancelled my subscription so I’m not charged again.---------My improvements within 4 weeks are hard to believe.  My freestyle is consistently faster by 6% with 100 yards.  And now I swim 250 yards with ease.  I think the improvements are result of having the MySwimPro App on Apple Watch to provide structural training.  And learning about rotation by following a few different drills.  The Apps on iPhone and Apple Watch are both very well done and stable.  The paid subscription is well worth it.---------My workout plan doesn’t sync with Apple watch at all. Workout often doesn’t register in the app. I’ve tried all of the steps recommended to remedy these bugs to no avail. It work seamlessly about four or five updates ago. I wish I could back. Even more disappointing give the coming price increase. As helpful as it is, a clunky app isnt worth a $1000 lifetime subscription. The yearly price increase (not yet announced) may be too steep without improvement in performance of the app.---------I will say that this app finally got me back to swimming after 4 years of not being able to get back in the pool. I can’t get into a swim team because of reasons so I had the worst time in making workouts for me. This app is worth its money! The way it is structured helps me ADHD brain to finally commit on doing something. My overall life has just become better because if it. I can’t thank you guys enough!---------As a former competitive swimmer getting back in the pool after 30 years, the workouts have been perfect in helping me get back up to speed. While I’ve got a long way to go, I’m not floundering around at the pool swimming junk yardage and made up sets. I’m looking forward to getting into the intermediate and advanced workouts. Plus there are multiple workouts for free, back, breast, IM, kick and sprint - really nothing short of hiring a coach to watch you. Highly recommend!---------****update*****. Administrator fixed the problem within 24 hours of my post. It’s a great app and now syncs with strava automatically.  *****update*****\\n\\n****original post*****. App is good for recording swimming. I got it only so I could sync data to strava. Been trying for hours to get my workouts to sync. I give up. The accounts are linked, but ok upload. Deleted and reinstalled 3 times. Nothing. So I just manually input the data that this app records.  Oh well.---------With Master Swim sessions at my pool suspended, My Swim Pro has been a great help at improving the quality and focus of my workouts in the pool.  \\n\\nThe daily workouts keep things fresh for me  and It’s great to have the option of tweaking them to fit my needs in the APP.  I also love how MSP tracks and records my entire workout -so cool!!!\\n\\nWhen Master Swim sessions come back to my pool I can tell you that MY Swim Pro will be with me for every stroke and kick.---------I really like the ability to write my own workouts with intervals and rest times.  The cool thing is it buzzes when I need to go on the next ‘rep’.  I’m also counting challenged and sometimes forget where I am in a 400 or 500 - a quick glance can confirm where I am on that rep.  I appreciate that I have the option to sign up for a monthly subscription but am not required to to use the basic functionality of the app.  Great development and execution!---------I downloaded this app for my Fitbit verse two. When it was installed, I was trying to figure it out; when I set it all up, I chose a workout, then I went on my Fitbit, and then I tap load work out. It said,” connect to phone, error with the connection. ” but so far, I wouldn\\'t grade this app for a lousy star rating. I think it needs to be connected to pads and iPhones. Even I am connected to the wifi; it does it too.---------I\\'m sure this app does a lot of great things but I only wanted to use the free version to log my own workouts using the Quick Log feature. But after logging my first workout the app will no longer easily let me change the minutes (duration) of my swim--it takes 10+ tries to change the time, if it works at all. It\\'s frustrating and hard to gauge my pace without an accurate time. Any fix for this? I do like that it connects to Strava.---------I was a seasonal competitive swimmer but during the off-season I didn’t have any coaching. This app helped me improve my swimming in the same way a coach would. It gives detailed workouts hat are made for each individual and allows people to start from any fitness level and teach their goals at their own pace. I highly recommend to everyone who’s looking to get into the pool and be productive. No matter the skill level---------I’m not one to write reviews, but I felt that this was important for those looking for a swim app. There are no free workouts at all, and when I tried to create a workout, I couldn’t find it again in the morning. It was very upsetting for me that EVERYTHING, from technique videos to training plans, all required payment to continue. As a college student who already doesn’t have much money to spare, yet wants to be able to improve swim speed and endurance before swim season, this app has been frustrating because of the inability to use any of the workout programs without paying the $20/month or $120/year subscription fee. Very disappointed.---------I was worried after my second back surgery that not only was my cycling race career over, but that my working out to stay healthy might be in peril, too. Thankfully, I got back in the water after a near 20 year hiatus. MySwimPro was a fundamentally significant part of my return not just to the pool and swimming, but even a bit of racing here and there. 5 medals in 5 races at my first Masters Nationals gave me the jolt to keep swimming and keep working. But, I always remember to swim happy!!---------I have really given this app a try for at least 3 months.  They fixed the issue of the Apple Watch not responding to the pressure to pause resume etc; but now 50% of the time the workout does not log;  although the workout appears  in the Health app of the iPhone, (and the data comes from the My Swim Pro) but it does not appear in the My Swim Pro app. I wish they could get it to work properly and consistently. Well $75 down the drain.---------I turned 45 in the middle of the weight loss program and this app has, no joke, changed my life haven’t really lost weight but I lost inches and have improved my cardio 5 fold and am now adding running and sprinting.  Most importantly this program combined with using the “expandalung” device has eliminated my asthma in a month and I’m not even finished the program, crazy.---------Been loving the app for months, without issue but....In the last few weeks the pause function in the workout stopped working. I updated to the newest version and the problem was resolved until midway through a workout. I just tried it again and the swim workout cannot be stopped, paused, or otherwise interrupted during a workout. It’s very frustrating.---------I have been using this app to train in the pool. My laps, strokes, time has been accurately uploaded to this app and Strava. I am also able to load the workouts. I currently have the Apple Watch 4 LTE and I’m sure it will work fine with the GPS only version. The app also automatically turns on the water lock on the phone and still lets you look at the screen when raising and looking at your wrist.---------I wanted to try this app out because it had great reviews and others I know use it. The signup process was tedious, the amount of emails I have received already is overwhelming, and when I tried to watch some videos through the iOS and iPadOS app, the video would try to launch, but then it would close the video immediately after trying to watch.\\n\\nIt was enough of a bad experience within the first 5 minutes to turn me away given the high price tag. I would hope that this money would be put to good use developing a high quality app that works.---------I got this app so I can customize my workouts and swim at my own pace. After three months of creating workouts I no longer can update my workouts to increase the distance because a very expensive subscription is required. I will have to go back to index cards to create my new workouts and only go in this app to record my workouts.  I suggest you create an option where the user can only customize their workouts and log their workouts. All the other stuff on there I don’t even look at.---------The app on my watch works great! I swim with a team, so I don’t often load a workout, but when I do, it’s a great workout tool. Normally we have a listed workout, so I start the app, put it in drill mode if we’re only kicking and it does a good job of recording my workout and times and strokes. \\n\\nThe problem comes when trying to analyze the workout on my iPhone after. Moving from screen to screen makes you want to tear your hair out with the lags and delays if not often down right freezing and often a sudden quitting of the app.\\n\\nAnd trying to load a workout for use on the watch runs into similar lags/freezes/reboots. \\n\\nThis behavior has only appeared this year and reports to support have been unable to solve the problem with each subsequent update. \\n\\nIt’s frustrating because there is a lot of useful data out there. You just can’t easily access it.---------I found the description to be a bit misleading for a free app. Yes the app is free but there is nothing you can do with out the paid subscription. I’m training for a triathlon and wanted a good resource to help with swimming workouts but the 7 day trial isn’t a long enough evaluation period for me to see if I want to spend $20/month on an subscription. I can track swimming on my Apple Watch so I don’t need the app without the premium features at all.  I thought that was a too costly considering I can’t tell what I would really be getting since everything is locked down. No thanks.---------Have been using MySwimPro for a few weeks now and I’m really enjoying how it keeps my workouts fresh and sequences them to push me to improve. I especially love the interval tracking and haptic feedback on the Apple Watch—it takes all the set thinking out of the picture and allows me to just focus on swimming hard :)---------This app really helped me keep track of my swim workouts when my swim team season ended I was trying to keep swimming an hour everyday but I wouldn’t have time to right down a workout and I was so used to my coaches making the workout that without them it was hard but this app really helped me keep track of what I was doing 10/10 recommend---------I’ve been a competitive swimmer for three years i’m 16 now and my club is on a month long break. i was looking for ways to not only stay in shape but get better while away at the same time taking a break from swim. these are the perfect workouts to work on whatever you might struggle with. a complete guide showing you what to do and when do it it’s amazing.---------I have been using this app for almost 3 months and just finished one of their training plans. It’s been a great experience both in and out of the pool as the team really listens to and welcomes feedback. \\n\\nIt has a great swimming glossary built into the app to help clarify any terms you might not know. In addition to that it’s easy to use and saves you having to memorize or write down your routines.---------I’m a swimmer on a team who likes to track down what we do every day. We swim about 2 times a day for 6 days a week and whenever I try recording my times from meets, it doesn’t even record down the time and I have to do it all over again. It’s very buggy and it’s split recording isn’t good. The good part about this app is that it makes it easier to record our practices and times but however, with these problems it makes it nearly impossible to.---------The perfect training tool! With this app on my watch, I actually show up to the pool and get a tough workout in. I swam my whole life and played water polo in college. After college I struggled with swimming on my own, it’s just so boring! MySwimPro definitely helps with keeping me accountable. Perfect training for masters swimming and polo. Love tracking everything too, cause “numbers don’t lie!”---------Been using for years and used to like it a lot. I understand the developers have to make money, but these days it’s quite annoying to use this app if you don’t need any to sign up for one of their paid subscriptions. It’s constantly barraging you to subscribe, make a training plain, etc. \\n\\nIf you want to use this app as your coach it’s probably a good one. But if you just want to track your swimming activity, there are probably better options now.---------As a former high school swimmer, I’ve been looking for a swim app that would not only record my stats but assist me with endurance, speed, and technique while physically in the pool. I can’t tell you how ecstatic I was after my first swim with this app. Total game changer !!! I can finally brag to my husband about all my metrics and geek out on all the analytics and swim plans!!! It’s like having your own personal coach on your wrist. Thank you!!!---------Have always been a swimmer. Needed some structure now that I live in an area without master swimming teams etc. Have been using this app for two years and appreciate it every time I complete a work out. Am not connected to a watch / device at this point and that is a little limiting at times.  Using Form goggles and only wish the two were connected.---------Freaking LOVE this app! I wish it was easier to filter the workouts by things like equipment or add dynamic adjustments to intervals when you miss some, but those are really minor gripes. I love not having to write my own workouts but being able to customize the premade ones if I want to. This app has made lap swimming so much more fun!---------Having to unlock the watch just to switch the reps is very difficult because there is water on the watch and that messes with the screen heavily. Only way it’s possible is to dry your hands and the watch every time. My suggest is being able to double click the crown button or side button to switch reps. I think this is a pretty big pit fall which is why I gave 3 stars. Otherwise it’s a great app.---------I love this app! As a swimmer this app is super user friendly and simple. I don’t have the premium version but the free routines they have are still good quality. I also love that you can make your own personal workout and track it. The only thing I wish for is more free routines. But besides that I love everything about this app.---------I love this app, it makes swimming fun and I look forward to using it every day. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it does not keep track of my lap times very well which in turn messes up the swolf score, my best times and lap splits, etc. That being said, I have tried the available swim apps and this is still the best swim app out there!---------As a swimmer there are many things you need to know, watch, learn, practice and count. Having a coach was something that helped but had limitations especially if you change countries and travel. Since I started with MySwimPro I felt the best professional coach I can ask for is back with me always whenever I need it.---------MySwimPro sets the ‘gold standard’.   I’ve hesitated to write a review until I really put this app thru it’s paces. It has been almost 4 years  since I started using MySwimPro.   Communication with there team is excellent.  The diversity of workouts is endless and there are training plans for every need from the beginner to the triathlete or masters swimmer.---------This app looked like a promising way to make my swim sessions more interesting but instead I got:\\n\\n* A “free” trial that ended in 30minutes (as soon as I cancelled auto renew). Apple still says my subscription should be valid for a week but the app suggests otherwise and keeps prompting me to sign up for premium again. This is in the best case a bug and most probably against apples terms of use.\\n\\n* Their companion Garmin app for the 735xt simply doesn’t work. It asks me to login via Garmin connect but in Garmin connect, under the app settings page it doesn’t provide any interface to enter your credentials like other Garmin connect apps do. Hopefully that’s a bug that can be fixed.\\n\\n* Initially Garmin sync would reset itself every time I entered “Account Settings”. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to get that working as expected.\\n\\nIt’s a real pity as pool swimming can be quite monotonous without a coaching aspect.---------I have been using the app since it was launched. Today I use it to measure pace, etc. I utilize the sync/import my workouts feature for the most part. However since the last couple of updates, they have come through broken. My 200s come through as 25s, 75s…even though when I look at them in the iOS Fitness app they are tracking together. Please take a look. Thx---------I encountered some issues that stopped the app from working at one point.  Thankfully, installing the most recent version fixed them.\\n\\nThe app makes it reasonably easy to write up and execute your own workouts.  Times recorded are not very accurate, but that may be more a function of the Apple watch than the app - each swim may be off by several seconds.---------I love all the features of this app and it truly is top notch. Unfortunately, the cost of subscription is unreasonably high. I understand the amount of work and the excellence that went into this, but it doesn’t serve people who need an app like this that is reasonably affordable. I already pay a gym membership premium. Having this would be excellent for training, but would be like adding an additional gym membership to my budget. \\nIf the subscription is ever lowered substantially, count me in!---------It is a good app with good plans. I use it most every day. The biggest issue is it doesn’t work with high end Garmin watches to export swim plans although it sells this as a feature. I have the MK1 and integrating between the app and devices is so complicated and never works. Even their customer service team could t figure it out.  \\n\\nThis also isn’t a product for people on a budget. You can find so many free workouts online. So it’s good but could be great. Just do your research.---------I switched from Apple Watch app because I’m looking to get more accurate info on my work out. I’m having trouble to connect to Facebook to connect with people, it keeps on kicking me back out. Now on my Facebook page it shows I have the app connected and it gave me my work out notification. But I’m not able to connect on MySwimPro. I didn’t upgrade, is that why it’s not working?? Please help.---------I have a Garmin watch and I can’t see any benefits of using the free app, the info appears to be about the same you get for free with your watch app. It seems the Apple Watch features are great for doing workouts in the pool. However, there are no free workouts, everything has to be paid for, even stuff that is free on their website and the price is really ridiculous if you just want the workouts. May be worth it if there is actually a proper coaching strategy but not sure that’s the case, didn’t even go for their free trial. Deleted.---------I was in the process of completing one of the training plans when I took a 6 week break for vacation. I needed to restart the program and no matter what I did on the app, I wasn’t able to go back to the first set of workouts. I emailed support through the app and received instantaneous responses fixing the issue in a matter of moments. Love this app!!!---------I have been using the app a few months and have actually switched to an annual subscription due to the value I gained from it. It is the next best thing to having a live coach and their customer service is the best I have seen from any app developer. Definitely a smart investment for any level swimmer.---------When using Garmin watch, it does not record distance for kick sets and distance is off on other intervals occasionally.  Also, it does not recognize your rest time for each interval, pace per 100 recorded in Strava includes rest, which is inconsistent with my previous workouts so makes progress monitoring challenging.---------The workouts are not challenging or tailored to my performance—annoying since the app has spent nearly 2 years collecting my data. The videos and various workouts can all be found (better) on the internet. Hardly worth $119. You’ll also receive all sorts of emails and “training” videos that are essentially advertisements pushing some product they’re in a partnership with—like a $200 device to build lung capacity. This may be helpful for beginners but if you’re an intermediate or above swimmer it’s not worth the money.---------I downloaded this app with high hopes. Unfortunately I encountered multiple issues right from the start, and eventually gave up and deleted it. \\n\\nAfter downloading the app to my phone and registering, I tried to open the app on my watch. It didn’t recognize that I had registered on my phone and wouldn’t move past the login screen. I had to restart my watch for it to log in. \\n\\nOnce I got past the login screen and tried to start a workout, the app froze on a screen telling me to spin the crown and force push the screen before I could move on to the workout screen... and I ended up having to restart again. \\n\\nFinally I got back in and started a workout. When it was time to end the workout, I spun the crown to unlock it... and then the app locked up again. I couldn’t end the workout. \\n\\n3 restarts in the first 10 min of using the app. Don’t waste your time.---------I can’t advise this enough - RUN and do not do the trial. I didn’t remember signing up for a year subscription, just a 7 day trial that would result in a monthly fee after. I was automatically charged $100 after 7 days. I stopped using the app after the first swim, as it shuts off my Apple Watch ability to track data using Apple Health. I cannot find a customer support number anywhere, even though they promise their “premium” members ample support. More like endless links to wiki articles with no human in sight. Don’t make this mistake folks. This is a fraudulent app.---------As a swim coach, I love that this app keeps me on track. I was frustrated with my Apple Watch that never counted my kicking laps and couldn’t get drill tracking correct either. This records all that I do. It also forces me to do the sets at the correct training paces. I highly recommend it for anyone unable to join a team.---------I loved my swim pro until this last update. Yesterday I updated and can no longer see the set on my screen. It looks too high and I can only see the interval. Also every time I swim or start a new set the water lock goes on.  I do not like the lock on. I am spending way too much time on the watch now. Any suggestions?---------Getting to connect is difficult, and keeping connected even more. I have an Ionic, I loaded a workout last night, tried to use it this morning and it was fine, had to leave the pool to go get the phone to load it again. Then the app would not work because it the watch was not connected to the phone (had synchronized a minute before). Finally, I got the workout in, dis the workout and the data never made it to Fitbit dashboard. I also have an Apple Watch, I’m gonna test it with it, if it doesn’t work I’m deleting this app, so far not worth the money.---------The app looks great there are a lot of workout options and I liked the layout inside the workouts…when I could see it. Which brings me to why I’m giving it 3 stars, 99.9% of the app is behind a pay wall and it’s expensive. To pay for it on top of the gym membership to access the pool is not worth it. Especially since it doesn’t even sync with my smart watch (Fitbit).---------Cool app nice to help keep track of my pacing and stuff. But I find it odd you have to load the workout on the app first and get it to sync before you can start. So I have to bring my phone with me to the pool to get it to work. Don’t like that since it could get ruined if it falls in the pool or something. Otherwise cool app. Please find a way to make it work without having to utilize the phone . Thanks---------The main thing I like about this app is it it tells you what your moving pace in the pool was, not just whatever interval you went on. i’m not sure how accurate it is in open water but I don’t use it for that very much. Still worth five stars---------I usually don’t leave reviews but really wanted to support the guys building MySwimPro. My swimming has taken off since I started using the app on my Watch. The workouts are great and very motivational. I don’t have the time to attend a club, but having a training plan and guidance through the workout has proved very valuable. Thank you!---------Upgraded to Apple Watch ultra from apple 6 . Not sure why it is not working at all The app swimpro stuck frozen on 2 screens - first screen: profiles stats: showing miles, hors & workouts - second screen : message : Apple Watch ultra has a resistance water of 100 But the app frozen on this message : we don\\'t recommend swimming with, or submerging an Apple Watch that is not rated water resistance 50 meters. Pls advise---------i was impressed with apple watch\\'s built in swim tracking, it would pay attention to when I was moving and when I wasn\\'t, logged pace per lap accurately\\n\\nI was happy to try MySwimPro because I appreciate all the how-to videos, but when running a 100yd exercise, if I only get half that done in the goal time, the watch still logs 100yds, so I have no idea how far I actually swam.---------Fantastic app, total game changer. Gives new meaning to your swimming especially in conjunction with an Apple Watch. I bought one just for this reason. It is that good.\\n\\nCan\\'t wait to see where this is going in the future, in particular with respect to even more personalization and community!---------I was very excited to see the new Apple Watch / swim app counted strokes because I have an endless pool so length of pool or gps are of no value.  I was very disappointed when the stroke count turned out to be length of pool/time and not actual strokes it seems if you can count steps you should be able to count strokes with latest and greatest Apple Watch---------This is a good app. I like it. But, all workouts are only available with a subscription, even the dry land ones which I was interested in due to the COVID-19 shutdown. Oh well. At least I can connect my Fitbit to it and use the app into a train by session. You can log workouts and it’s very helpful! I only gave it four stars because there should be at least 2 free workouts.---------I wish there was an app like this for every exercise. Would be great for track running and interval type workouts. Even regular lifting to a schedule would be great with this type of app.\\n\\nWould love the opportunity to build my own workouts, but the workouts they provide are well done.---------I’ve really appreciated using this app on my iwatch, dug how it pushes your workout/set details into Strava, but with iOS9 on my iwatch8  stops recording as soon as I hit the water. Not sure what’s up. I’ve tried starting it several times and the app just closes.  Not sure if it’s a bug with iOS9, a bug with low power mode for workouts, etc.   regardless I Had to go back to relying on another app :(.   Let me know if I can provide any other feedback to help problem solve. \\n\\nBest to your dev team 🤘🏼---------At 3 times the price of comparable apps I expect an app that works. Display while swimming is nicer than Apple Watch and it’s nice that some programs are included and displayed on screen but lap counts are less accurate than apples native app, the program is constantly wrong about which ones I have completed and the way it dynamically tries to update my times is way off. Will be trying out some other apps or sticking with Apple watch’s swim tracker as advantages over a printed swim workout are minimal.---------I was using the Apple Watch swim activity and that normally worked fine but I was doing lengths with little purpose. MySwimPro has me working on improving my technique leading to better times and increased fitness. Plus, having a workout to complete means I normally end up doing more than I was before.---------It’s not just about getting good at swimming, because you will. Nor is it just about getting fit, because you will. It’s about fostering community and inclusivity, encouraging excellence with enthusiasm, and having a lot of fun. The customer service team is on point, and no one will let you fail.---------A great and well made app! One tip for beginners: setting intervals for your workouts to “no interval” allows you to manually advance each set, rather than being subject to a timer which can be difficult when just getting used to structured swim workouts. \\n\\nThanks to the devs for their prompt and helpful support!---------MySwimPro has made a huge difference in my swim workouts. There are SO MANY resources and great tech support. The personalized workouts really work for me. I have increased my swim skills and speed significantly since I started using it. I highly recommend it for anyone-at any skill level!---------Actually closer than 2nd ... this app gives serious swimmers so much, to complain about its kinks is  ungenerous. That the app isn’t super slick is beside the point. That watches don’t do as advertised in many situations is not Myswimpro’s fault. This app opens a world of coaching and training advice. I love it.---------Latest update gets splits for your reps if you load a workout to your watch- even if you don’t have time to put the workout in beforehand (like me) it does a pretty good job at figuring out your workout sets and intervals. The workout of the day every day is worth the premium subscription alone 👊🏼---------Although I grew up swimming in a pool, I have never swam for anything other than leisure. Due to a bad back I decided I wanted to try and learn techniques of swimming laps. This app gave me a workout but not what any of it means. What’s an FR, KI, IM, DR, etc? It’s not broken down into real basics. This appears more for someone who swam on team at some point. I don’t know technique and there are not videos for all the strokes. Pretty disappointed with this app advertising to true beginners such as myself. The search continues....---------I used to swim without a plan, which I see is a huge mistake. Swimming with MySwimPro is fun, stimulating, challenging, and I learn a lot from the training videos. I have other swimmers using it now at the Y. Highly recommend. I want to swim when I am 94 so please stay in business.---------I use this app in China to keep up with my swimming. One Sunday I swam 8500m (that’s 9295 yards). I’d NEVER swim that much alone. I just wouldn’t. I’d get way to bored. But myswimpro kept the workout fresh and exciting, keeping me on pace every few hundred yards. It’s like an über masters coach, loaded with great workouts that you can bring anywhere. \\n\\nI also use myswimpro with my normal masters swimming program to get in extra distance before and after workouts (like today where the normal workout was 3600 but myswimpro kept it real for 8500). \\n\\nPerfect for long distance swims to keep things interesting. \\n\\nI love myswimpro!!!---------This app is very high quality but almost all of the structured workouts require the paid subscription. The biggest let down is not being able to create a custom workout for free. I would have rated a 5/5 if not for that.---------the workouts are great and work well with my apple watch. i like using the training programs, however when i complete a workout from one of the programs the app doesn’t update - it still shows that my next workout in the program is workout #1. to resolve the issue i have to log the workouts as completed from the program page and then go back and delete those workouts in order for my training program progress to update. it’s super annoying, especially when this app is fairly expensive as far as monthly subscription workout apps go - hence the two stars. for $20/month i expect smoother functioning.---------Ok so was wanting a swim workout that would work with my iWatch as well this seemed to fit the bill I signed up with my Twitter and it never opens keeps telling me error also does pop up a reminder banner here and there I have deleted and downloaded a few times and keep getting the same thing\\n\\nHad to do it with my email Twitter wasn’t working. as a log in---------Can’t begins to describe how well-designed and intuitive this app is. MSP is a strong platform - the best out there and I’ve tried ‘em all. Lots of digital tools to support your training and growth. Excellent customer service if you ever need it.---------Look, I’ve only been at this for sixty days after pretty much not doing anything since 2020. I was very excited to get an Apple Watch, and read about how great these swim apps are. Too bad you don’t qualify until you can swim at least 500 yards. The REAL outta shape need not apply here, I guess. That’s really too dang bad because this would probably help me get to 500 yards quicker. \\nYou know, developer, it’s a dang numerical slider- y’all chose to start it there- Shame.---------This is based solely on the app experience and the design. It’s very poorly designed with text overlapping on the same color background impacting legibility. There’s a strange bug with some of the video tutorial that won’t minimize when you try to scroll down to read content. Worst of all, I didn’t see a single free workout on this app, its all geared for paying the premium price with annoying banners and ads everywhere.\\n\\nTotal sham, I actively uninstalled it.---------I’ve subscribed to this app and unsubscribed because it simply doesn’t work consistently. When it does work, it’s great. But the other 45% of the time, it won’t count laps on the Apple Watch, so you start swimming and 30 minutes later realize it’s recorded 0 laps. Super frustrating. Contacted support, they were friendly, but could not fix the problem. Save your money and just use Apple’s workout app, works every time.---------I’ve used this app for years and they seem to have taken away the ability to even write your own workouts into it without paying an exorbitant fee. There is nothing free about this app, they should just charge the hefty price for it in the App Store to even download it.\\n\\nShould have kept the paid features to the workouts written for those that want to pay for them. This app is useless without paying.---------Love the app. Been a subscriber for a few months now, just bought a Garmin forerunner 745 because as most triathletes know the apple watch doesn’t cut it as a real fitness watch. You do not support this device so I stopped my subscription… happy to start it back up if you add the forerunner 745. \\nPry not the only customer you are losing because of this.---------This happened at least a couple of times for me.. after swimming for 30 mins or so, when I try to press and hold to end or pause my workout it just wouldn\\'t respond to long press. I either had to kill the app or restart my Apple watch 4. But by then my workout is not saved 😌. Really a piece of crap app this one is.. I also bought a yearly subscription a couple of days ago and I will simply cancel the subscription..---------Initially impressed by how slick this app looks and the ability to create your own work-outs, until I discovered it has very limited functionality (e.g. see lap analytics, split times and pace, and most of the workouts) unless you pay the $180/yr subscription fee to unlock those features. I guess I’ll stick to my free Swim . Com app which has most of the same features.---------I am a former competitive swimmer who wasn’t pushing myself hard enough in the pool. This app provides excellent workouts and training programs that are challenging and satisfying. I love that it adjusts to MHz skill level. It syncs well with my Garmin watch. I have only great things to say about this app.---------I am a great user of this app but I had to uninstall it from my new Apple Watch (series 5), tried few times and it was unresponsive even after unlocking the waterproof mode. I am Waiting for a fix to enjoy the daily WOD again---------MySwimPro is the best of all the swim apps, but it\\'s now priced so expensively. I get there are a lot of dedicated swimmers who use the app and many of the features are geared toward them, but what about the casual, beginner swimming, or couch to 3000m swimmer? I\\'d rather pay for a set training regime because I don\\'t need or use the whole catalog of workouts. There isn\\'t a decent equivalent to the couch to 5k apps they have for running.---------I’m a beginning swimmer and hoped to find some direction with the free trial before deciding if both swimming and this app are for me. But you have to subscribe for the free trial. That model really bothers me as it puts the burden on the user to cancel, rather than just locking the user out after 30 days. I won’t play that game. Oh well. App deleted.---------Let’s finish the hassle to find a coach.. \\nThe Science is here behind this app..\\nAll you need to know about your progression in swimming like: laps, heart rate, stroke per lap, swolf score, meters, calories, etc..\\nThis app will help you achieve your goals in no time.---------Fantastic swim (and now dry land) programmes, generally very easy to use. Swim programmes are varied and you feel and see the results quickly. The dry land ones are like having a PT! \\nAlso, they’re very approachable, and fix any issues super quickly. Highly recommend.---------I uninstalled last year because it stopped recording without warning. Decided to give it another try. It was really sweet for 2 workouts, and now it’s back to not recording again.---------I downloaded the app to track my swimming, didn’t know it’d cost a monthly fee around $20. Had I known that I wouldn’t have downloaded the app. I feel like it should’ve been in the app description so I’d know not to download it. \\n\\nOn top of that I have to get their stupid spam every few weeks. I tried to unsubscribe but I still get it and I never asked for it.---------I loved this app. Then it broke a couple of weeks ago.\\n\\nBut as of today, this latest update is AMAZING! \\n\\nThanks for adding the visual refresh and fixing the buttons bugs. Really. This is great!---------Has good features and workouts but if your walls are decent it will not track your distance correctly. From there it’s far to cumbersome to return to the app and correct the distance.---------Never could I believe that at my age I would be a good swimmer and enjoy it. And doing 1500\\nYards every other day. Thank you MySwimPro.\\n\\nStill going strong and enjoying my swimming. Getting strong I am getting better. I’m seventy two years feel like 60 or better. Thanks MySwimPro.---------I had a problem syndicate workouts with my Fitbit Ionic. I contacted Fares via WhatsApp and reached out to me directly And assigned one of his team to call me, in Poland no less. My problem was solved and Fares demonstrated that the art of customer service is not lost.---------I had high hopes for this app , but i was very disappointed. I signed up for a trial period, the app doesn’t work well with my watch and doesn’t deliver as promised so I cancelled the premium membership before trial expired. They charged my card regardless. There’s no way to get on touch with support , although I tried several times . They keep trying to charge my card every 2 days. I would love to hear back from MySwimPro and have this issue sorted out .---------I really like the app, however after the first few times of it working perfectly, I am no longer able to end my workout.  It doesn’t crash like other reviews said, but it is still frustrating.  I now manually enter the workout on my iPhone.  It was better when I didn’t have to do that.---------Loved the app until about two weeks ago. Now, all you can do is look at multiple offers to subscribe. It’s now so laggy I can’t even see previous swims, any given swim split times, or my accomplishments. It just stops responding. \\n\\nWhen it works right it’s “*****” (five stars). \\n\\nPLEASE FIX IT!---------When skipping intervals (for example the interval is 5mins but you finished in 4 and want to get to the next set), the app has a tendency to either freeze on the timer or just end the workout and not save any of your workout. DO NOT USE THIS APP UNTIL ITS FIXED. It has been going on the past month including my workout this morning after their latest update two days ago.---------Quite a few good features but unless you are swimming nearly every day there’s almost no way to take advantage of most of them. If you decide to quit, good luck trying to cancel your subscription. The manage subscription function on both the app and the website won’t let you login no matter what browser you use.---------This app used to be wonderful- it would let you track workouts through time, record your PRs, etc. If you wanted, you could pay for workout suggestions and coaching. Now you must pay an absurd fee for everything- even logging your own workouts. A monthly subscription costs as much as my pool fee- and that’s just to track workouts!---------Needs tons of bug fixes.  Not sure why anybody would pay or join, when you can’t change any of your workouts.  It only sets the workouts by some computer program, nothing the swimmer may want.  You can’t save any changes, very frustrating.---------This thing is like being on dial up in 2001. I love it but I hate how it stalls and is so slow when I add my own workouts in. I updated and have all the new features but it’s still so friggin slow when I save my workout or tap on share. iPhone 8 Plus user.---------Used to be able to write my own workouts and save up to 5 at a time. Now it won’t even let me write my own workouts without paying a high amount. \\n\\nIf you want the coaching and the workouts, then this app can be great. However, I have workouts from my coach and used the app to write my workouts and keep me on pace. Now that I can no longer do this, I have no use for this app.---------I’ve been using the MSP app about a month and love it. Workouts are easy to follow and have helped improve my swim.  I also have had quick response when asking questions or needing advice.  Overall, great app.---------I love the app but have to print out workouts to use with my garmin because when I use the watch to train it adds hundreds of yards to my swim. The workouts are great but hope the bug gets fixed.---------I spent over 10 minutes filling out all of the information just to come to the screen where you have to actually make a purchase. That is horrible practice for any company that is on the App Store. It should be way more obvious.  \\n\\nShame on you and your company. I was really looking forward to this app but I’m not even going to bother. I will find something else.\\n\\nBoooooooo 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼---------I downloaded this app so that I could find a good swim set for a few beginner swimmers to swim in order to prepare for being at sea for a week. I was instantly disappointed to find that the only way to use both the pre-made sets and the monthly plans was to pay $180 bucks a year to use the apps premium function, which is outrageous for the quality of the product you get. Very disappointed!---------I thought there would be short videos and information for all levels of swimmers. Instead, there’s videos that you can’t watch unless you have a subscription, and short articles that take you to their website. This app is useless unless you pay to upgrade it by subscription.---------Way too expensive. The free version is so limited it nearly worthless. Need a $5 one time purchase version with ability to create more than 5 workouts. I found the training plans did not fit my pace so I had to modify all of them, eliminating the time savings of not having to enter it myself. \\n\\nAlso, it seems to monitor my yards accurately in a 25 yard pool but is way off in a 50m pool (as much as 500 yards in a 2,000m workout)---------I downloaded this app as a never before swimmer to see how it worked. I am familiar with auto renew for apps. However, this app auto renews without “warning your free trial is up” alert that I have always gotten with other apps.   I had planned to pay for a month once the period was up to see if\\nI found the app useful. However, the app auto renewed for a full year, and my requests to auto renew at a monthly rate was denied.---------I have accessibility issues, and swimming is one place where I don’t feel handicapped. This app changed that for the worst. If you have problems with small movements or joint issues in your hands, I advise choosing another app. I couldn’t shut it off when my swim was done. Even after drying off and physically taking the watch off, I had to remove the app from my phone to turn stop my workout!---------Great App. I synch it up with my Apple Watch and it delivers my workout set by set. There is always a workout of the day (WOD) and if that does not work for you there are plenty of others to choose from. Upgraded to Elite after a month of using the free App. Worth every penny!---------I enjoy learning all the new techniques to swim longer and stronger. I am a long time swimmer but have gotten away from it for years. Enjoy the community here within the swim pro app.---------It seems like a really good app for either open water workouts or pool workouts but whenever I tried to find a workout that was right for me it was locked and told me I had to upgrade. I would be OK with paying $5 a month but the subscription was $12 a month!!! Personally I thought it was not worth it and there are plenty of cheaper alternatives.---------When you pause the workout on the Apple Watch, it won’t resume no matter what buttons I try. I have to end my workout and restart, which makes it difficult to accurately track---------I really like the new format. The workouts are great and I like how you can adjust distances, times, number of reps, and save the workouts. It is much more functional.---------Great app, except you have to pay for all the workouts and whenever I go to the community page it bugs out and sends me to the home page---------Integrated well with Strava on Apple Watch 4. It’s the only solution I could find for that purpose. Also recorded very accurately and the staff were helpful as I tried to configure things.---------Not sure how I lived without MSP. I feel like I have my own personal coach. Workouts are great and engaging. Videos are helpful for someone like me. Love my swim log!!! Highly recommend to all my fishy friends.---------This app is really helpful, whether I want a structured workout or just want it to log my swim in the pool. The information it provides after a swim is really great.---------The actual app is good enough, but as of now, it looks like the technique videos aren’t loading on iOS. This is a shame, because those instructional videos are the primary reason I bought a membership. Hope this gets fixed soon before I cancel the free trial.---------I have tried many trackers and swim focused plans. This is the best by far to keep you disciplined and help follow very well thought out work out plans .---------So inconvenient when you want to be accurate on your activity tracker, when I saved the workout to upload it to my Apple Watch, automatically recorded as if already done it, and I didn’t! Now my activity for the day recorded the workout without swimming! The worst part is that I can’t erase it ones it’s done.---------Pretty good at tracking my workouts, however I get tons of notifications for workouts that are completed by people I don’t know and I don’t follow. There doesn’t seem to be a way to turn those notifications off.---------I used this to basically relearn to swim as an adult and it’s turned me into a consistent lap swimmer. I can’t recommend it enough, especially now they dry and wet programs are integrated.---------Love this app.  Worth the money. I download workouts to my Garmin and do whatever it says. Improved my fitness and helped me when doctors told me to swim more and run less.---------I like the app very much. I was having trouble opening the app on my Apple Watch. I  emailed the support team and received a quick response and a fix. \\nThank you!!!---------Hi swim pro I really like swim pro because I love swimming and I have been swimming since I was 1 years of old and so me day I want to work with dolphins and swim with them           Sincerely Rebekah---------It was alright until this update.  It has crashed 3 times in 2 days in the middle of my workouts.  It’s frustrating when you are 75% done with your workout and it stops and erases your progress.  I think I’ll just go back to doing it old school.  At least laminated paper doesn’t crash.---------I understand subscribing for personalized and updated content, but now My Swim Pro won’t even let you create your OWN workout without paying $30 per month. I’d be willing to buy the base level app (manually create and log workouts). The free version isn’t even as good the native Workouts app for Apple Watch!---------This app did not work well.  I have an iphone 7+ and tried using it this morning.  After my swim, i saved my workout on my watch only because my phone was not nearby.  Two hours later, i cant find the workout, nor can i upload it to the app on my phone.  This app is not so refined, nor is it intuitive.  Hopefully a developer comes up with abetter one.---------I’ve updated my review, the developers worked to figure out what was causing the iWatch app to crash during my swim, and suggested a temp fix I could use until the update js published.  Great team, functional app, likes this.---------Loved using the app to track practices and it showed my progress throughout the season! Every swimmer should have this app---------It is rare to see an app where tech support responds to users directly. The latest updates are awesome and super user friendly.---------There’s simply nothing like it. I started using it early 2020 and it is truly a powerful tool for swimmers. Allows me to follow a plan with real time motivation and accountability. Real fun and well done.---------The entire app is a subscription you have to pay for. Dont you guys think you should have a hand full of workouts that are free so the user can determine if they like it or not?\\n\\nI cant give the app a chance and i’m obviously not paying $20 for something I dont know if I want. I genuinely don’t get how this became so famous---------I really like what this app has the possibility of doing but unfortunately it’s not there yet. Still has problems stopping app on Apple Watch and doesn’t accurately calculate distance in open swims. Really difficult to stop app and close so information is sent to exercise app.---------Loved the stats and the workouts available but has anyone else had an issue of the app not being able to close? When I was done swimming I went to hit finish and it wouldn’t let me. Ended up closing it out but it would keep reopening. Had to delete it eventually just so the app would stop.---------All it does is provide an ad for the subscription services the offer. Click on anything within the app and you get an ad to upgrade to Pro. The worst kind of app there is. Extremely annoying and there is no option to turn it off. Yet it’s the only swim tracker that the Apple Watch supports.---------I use this app to help me count my calories, distance and my exercise as I swim! It helps me when other apps cannot!---------You no longer get basic stats like heart rate without paying a hefty subscription. Might be worth paying for if you’re a competitive swimmer but if you’re just using it to exercise, to lose weight, it’s just too much. I already have subscription fatigue. This is just too much.---------MySwimPro has helped me gain a significant insight into my swimming! A great swim tracking app that can be used by all swimmers. Using this app, I got great workouts daily to improve my speed in all four strokes!---------So I have been using this terrible app for the past year. It is basically worthless. I used to pretend that the logged swims were accurate because I was so ready to support this app.  After a year of completely inaccurate results  with no improvement I’ve decided that this review was necessary.  I’m very critical because I am software rengineer and I wold be ashamed to release such a piece of garbage.---------Unless you pay for the subscription which I can’t afford as it’s way to pricy you can’t do anything in the app. There are claims you get 5 workouts but every workout is locked it’s a huge scam. I don’t care how helpful it could be putting everything behind a paywall despite what is promised in the free use of the app is a scam.---------I’d try it again but 15$ a month!?\\nHopefully, Apple will further develop their own app.---------The app is a pretty good coach, but in terms of tracking swimming when paired with a Fitbit Versa and an iPhone 8.... it’s garbage.\\n\\nDon’t bother.\\n\\nEven tried the advanced “up-sell”, still nothing.\\n———-\\nUpdate: Based on Reading over reviews, it seems like this company is more interested in appearing helpful than actually making a product that functions properly.\\n\\nDo you know how much money and employees they must dedicate to troubleshoooting? Have you ever seen another review where the developer has tried so hard (with robot responses) to seem like they care.\\n\\nIt all makes sense.\\n\\nGarbage app that should be removed from the APP store!---------This is a great app- as a long distance open water swimmer the workout and dry land have been instrumental in directing and planning my workouts. Very worthwhile.---------I really want to like it but the constant pop ups about buying a $170 annual subscription are a nuisance. \\n\\nIn addition the program is slow to respond and the screen freezes up.---------This guy videos are great and it seems like the app has a lot to offer, but the free version has nothing of it! \\n\\nNothing at all! There’s a free trail but that’s not good enough as you have to add your credit card info…\\n\\nThe yearly price is very overpriced, there should be a single payment that unlocks the app not a subscription!! Ripp off!---------If your subscription expires, all data you paid for previous period is also hidden immediately. \\nSo, even no history for you if do not continue to pay.---------Does not load work-outs. Repeated crashes (despite of the app being deleted and then reinstalled). I definitely would NOT recommend this app, and more importantly I would not pay a cent for this piece of garbage! Anyone who makes the mistake of buying this scam app exposes themselves to being ripped off like I was.---------Great swim workouts and great tracking. MySwimPro would be outstanding if it included a web-based interface that allowed users to use all of its features on a larger format.---------Workouts won’t load. Sent an email they were able to add it for me. I was grinding for two weeks really enjoying it. Now I open up the app to find it added a different program and erased all the numbers and times I’ve added. 🤷🏽\\u200d♂️ found a different workout app with no bugs  save your self the headache---------I am a 10 year old swimmer and Im not too sure about how to use it but just seeing a swimming app brightens up my day,(I also have a swim meet on March 13 so good luck to me).---------Since the most recent update the heart rate data from my workouts no longer syncs to strava. Please fix, thanks. Otherwise great app!---------I like having my workout on my watch---------They’ve been trying to charge my card for two weeks now after I’ve cancelled everything and contacted them to ask them to stop running the card. I have no current subscriptions but they don’t seem to care. They just want money.---------It’s an amazing app, I started using this app 3 weeks ago and every time I open it I feel so motivated---------Not only it measured laps in my watch while I wasn\\'t even moving (!), it completely drained my Apple Watch faster then anything I ever saw, and now my watch won\\'t even start (green snake of death)!\\n\\nI hope this app will be removed from the App Store till those problems that can really harm your watch be fixed!---------If everything did not cost something then this app would probably be awesome. But unless you pay you don’t have access to anything. I’ve been a swimmer for who knows how long and I would rather just watch a video on line than get this.---------I love the app but would really like to see a taper function that can be utilized for competitions.---------Still using and loving the app! Love the updates and new features. Thank you guys for the best swim app ever!---------App has great potential only if you’re willing to pay $30 per month.  I’m not planning on being an Olympian so I find it hard to justify. I’ll use the $30 to buy 7-8 gallons of gas each month.---------I love this app. I use it primarily to log my time & distance each morning. I gives me fun milestones as I go greater distances.---------Best swim app hands down. Most detailed and most immediate support for any level.---------I subscribed for a full year at their outrageous rate, but found the app nearly featureless for my open water swimming. As I look around the app, nothing here justifies a $4.99/week price. Zilch! Absurd pricing.\\n\\nOnce I found the swim dot com app I loaded that on to my Apple Watch and never looked backz---------The app is a great concept, but it is extremely buggy and will often delete parts of sets I have made. The subscription is great, but is extremely expensive and you would get more out of a masters or club team. Don’t waste your money.---------It won’t open with my Apple Watch.  When i tried to set up an account on my watch , it kept telling me to enter a valid email.  Uh- that was a valid email.  Not worth the hassle. It even tells you open up your app to use with the watch... ya speak work either.  I’ll find something else.---------If you have the motivation to sweat and take action, this app helps you take action smartly.---------I have been waiting for you to add Garmin support. Unfortunately, it is not logging my work out very well. I do enjoy the videos, and the workouts, but for the app to add real value that has to properly capture my swimming.---------Almost all workouts require a subscription.  29/month or 179/year.  Everything free is tracking and the community. I didn’t click through on the community link so I don’t know how far in you go without a subscription.---------Using the app for almost 2 years. Really enjoy seeing my improvement  on a daily basis---------This app allows you to download it for free but everything I’ve checked out is a paid feature. \\n\\nIt looks legit, and if I paid for it, I’m sure I’d improve, but at least give something for free, and no not a 7 day trial that will charge me at the end(I know a can cancel right when I start the trail to not pay).---------The app itself is great, I love how easy it is to make programs, however when I try to load a program on my Fitbit Versa it says “connection error” I have tried uninstalling the app, but nothing seems to work regardless of what I’m doing.---------The amount of functionality that’s locked behind a subscription is pretty out of control. At the very least, I expect to be able to structure my own workouts, without being able to tap into guided workouts and coaching.---------Worked great at first.  Now I experience connection and tracking problems all the time.  It will just cut off in the middle of my swim and not log it.  During free swim will not log the distance at all.  Today swam 825 meters it logged 275 meters.  Very disappointed.---------This free version is worthless. There is nothing there. I don’t mind if you want me to purchase more but don’t pretend you are giving me something. I’m so disgusted with your worthless free version I refuse to buy from you. On top of that $15/ month is ridiculous too. Now I just want to tell other swimmers not to support such nonsense.---------I’ve been using this app for a couple of years now and find it’s not accurate in recording distance (always short) and lately there has been trouble transferring my swim workouts to my account.  I using an Apple II watch and iPhone7.---------This App and everything it offers is astounding! Couldn’t be better!  Best app, year after year IMHO.  Improved everything for me!---------The app it is the best around for swimming but the app freeze each time I try to log or just watched the work out. Even I am not a free member. It is not randomly it happens 100%. \\nSometimes during the work out it also freeze, now this issue does happen now and then. \\n\\nBut over all it is good and it is the best out there. \\n\\nHopefully they will fix this little issues I am experincing with it. \\n\\nEnjoy---------I purchased the app in full for a year . It’s expensive so I didn’t expect difficulty. The videos don’t play immediately. Also the graphics overlap on my programs---------I went on this app thinking there would be many workouts and I could actually do things! But no. I have to get an elite membership just so I can unlock the workouts I actually want to do. I do NOT recommend this app to anyone who actually wants to swim and workout.---------Awesome app.  Very user friendly and reliable.  I use it six days a week with the Apple Watch.---------You can’t do anything with this app unless you pay for elite. I can basically log a workout and that’s it. I can’t watch any of the videos or get a set to help me structure a workout, not worth it unless you wanna pay for it!---------Really great app in theory, but has a lot of bugs. I have some workouts that I started to check the interface out but didn’t actually do, but I can’t seem to delete them???---------Very misleading on the App Store. Appears to have a free version with some limited features but really has nothing at all. Would not even show me all the workouts that I manually inputted and logged. I don’t mind pay apps but don’t appreciate being deceived into a useless download.---------I was so excited to get the app and my new waterproof case from catalyst... well it won’t even let me start the workout and displays a warning... okay I have a waterproof case I’m not stupid... but the app doesn’t work!!! Really????---------I used to love this app. I don’t know what happened. I took a break from swimming and when I came back it won’t track laps. Twice I hit start and after swimming several laps I looked at my watch and it was as if I never hit start.---------This has some incredible stuff, and has the potential to be great. The structured workouts with vibration technology are really cool. But the stats and splits are so BAD it’s terrible. If you have a garmin and the stats are deal breaker for you….DO NOT BUY.---------I already paid the yearly subscription, I hope I won’t get charge 2 times---------The app used to let you do more with the Free version, but now everything is behind a paywall. You can’t even create a workout without a subscription. Definitely not worth.---------What an amazing app to track my swim workouts! Definitely motivates me to do more and keep getting better!---------Everything you click on brings you to a page to sign-up for “elite” membership (at $180/year!). No information or help is free, just a link back to that page. What a let down!---------Easiest way to keep up with laps and stats One found yet. SO SIMPLE to use and follow!---------The app is wonderful if you’re willing to dish out about 200 bucks a year. That’s more than my gym membership.. it’s unfortunate that there is no middle ground. Like a low rate to create your own workouts. Its free or $200 bucks. Where’s the middle ground?---------I just know this app is amazing and that if it does work it would be fantastic. The problem is that it doesnt. I cant seem to open any of the training plans. Hopefully they fix this so I can give it a 4-5 star.---------Often buggy: delayed logging, missed logging after start, eyc. Can\\'t rely on it to Just Work. Strong customer service but need to focus more on the app testing and reliability.---------This continued bothering of swimmers trying to get them to use the paid tier is super annoying. Then the main guy giving people swim advice: talk about creepy using competitive swimmers footage to\\ntout his swim knowledge. The whole vibe from this company shouts rip off---------Using the MySwimPro App, Joining the Online Facebook Community and Having your Swim Video Analysis creates a full package for beginners to advanced swimmers!---------How will people know if they want to decide to upgrade to pay for access to all of the workouts (required now to use at all, didn’t used to be) if there are no free workouts to use and test out first? Bring back a couple free workouts!---------I stumbled across this app and love it. With Covid 19 running rampant, I’ve been team less. This app is a great AI coach, lol!---------I used to like this app but the free version is completely non functional. I can’t press one button. Can’t even subscribe if I wanted to lol. Hard pass until next update.---------I paid for a year membership and is unable to load workouts from iPhone to Apple Watch. Installed app and uninstalled app on both phone and watch but the workouts still won’t sync to my Apple Watch.---------About as accurate as I’ve seen for any app in the water.---------Paid app looks legit, but the free app isn’t anything more than an advertisement for the paid app. Maybe someday, but need something to get started before taking on another monthly subscription. Deleted app.---------Very disappointed. Just installed the app. Not any purchase was mention in preview. I was surprised not found any even simple option of workout to see how it’s working. Don’t want to buy in blind. Reinstalled.---------This app is great for everyone even if you don\\'t have premium---------Fluid app design and extremely easy to use. Must get---------The app keeps freezing and don’t let me edit my workout, what I have to do since it doesn’t track kicks workout. It is very slow and I’m very upset---------Have done a couple open water swims and app glitches and adds 200+ yards every time by picking up a GPS coordinate way away from my actual location.---------Was great when I was able to build custom workouts for free. But with the latest update it’s behind the paywall and for $180 a year I’d rather just write my workouts on a sticky note---------I love MySwimPro. Love white board Wednesday. My strokes are getting better and I am getting faster!---------If you want a free app for your Apple Watch that is a good tool for swimming expect to pay $99 a year for subscription. Otherwise the free features do not even compare to default Apple app.---------It’s a nice app but way overpriced. I’d wait until more developers hit the market and a free version will come out. I have a Fitbit versa and it’s still buggy, for a $100+ a year subscription I would expect a lot more out of the app.---------The app looks great, but is there a way to import all past swims that have been synced with Strava. Past month? Past year?---------App helped me learn to swim as an exercise. Highly recommend!!---------Nice features but completely overboard with sales pitches. Just about deleted in disgust, but I wanna see how it integrates with my Apple Watch and explore a bit  more…---------I would like to check it out, but the app crashes whenever I try to signup. Wasn’t ever able to check it out.---------There’s always some sort of bug no matter what update happens…---------Hopeless when combined with the Fitbit.  Not intuitive at all.  Gets stuck and cannot be modified.  I’ve uninstalled it several times along with resetting the Fitbit.  No go.   \\nWaste of time.---------Apple Watch app not working - It won’t even open.\\n\\nUpdate: app opens on watch. Going to try it out soon!---------This was a great app for making custom workouts for several years…until they decided they wanted $180 a year. Delete.---------I am trying to import my old training from Apple Watch but when I click on import all nothing happens. Please fix it!!---------As a newbie I just wanted to learn how to swim better and improve my technique. Looks like this app is more suited towards the hardcore swimmers because most features like workout and coaching require a $10/mo subscription.---------This app violates a basic tenant of design and then tries to charge an absurd premium. All I want is an app that can track my workouts. Not so hard, is it?---------I tried to log my workout in Custom Workout, but it just does not accept the distance, so I\\'m about to delete it.---------Was billed $130 for a premium membership I never signed off on or agreed upon. Gonna clear this up with my bank but shame on the developers for creating an app that scams people in this way.---------No real functionality with out 30/m subscription. Disappointed.---------It makes you think it’s free until it surprises you after you downloaded it with 127 dollars a month in order to continue. Don’t get this app it’s a waste of time.---------The app should not be listed as free when it literally bombards you with paid subscriptions as soon as you touch any button. \\nDeleted…---------Every single workout I click on, either swim or dry land makes me pay for there subscription. It seams like a useful app but not for $120-$130 year and I can’t try any without signing up for the “free” 39 day trial.---------Great workouts and really motivating!---------Can’t speak to the content of the videos as I didn’t go past the paywall, but this app deleted my two months worth of log details without warning. Pretty worthless. I’d rather use pen and paper... AND IM A MILLENNIAL---------It doesn’t work well with my Apple Watch!!    The pressure push to get the menu doesn’t work.  Fix it then it’ll be a 5 star---------Do you really expect people to pay for a subscription when your free app doesn’t work at all? Yet another YouTube’r trying to scam you. Buyer beware!---------This app was great until it quit working unless you paid for the upgrade.---------I was all excited to start my custom workout, got in the pool, pressed start on my apple watch, and was off on my first lap out of 4 in my first set. I finished 4 laps and went to take my break with the left over time from the interval that I scheduled between the sets. I looked down and to my amazement, the app did NOT count any of my laps towards the first set! I twirled the crown to unlock the water 💧 lock, had to swipe right, tap the “next rep” button for it to account for a completed 1 rep (1 lap), then it auto-locks, I had to twirl the crown to unlock again, swipe left, tap the next rep button to account for the 2nd lap I had already completed, and repeated this process for each lap I had already finished. I had no idea that after each lap, I have to unlock the water-lock, swipe, and tap next AFTER EACH LAP! I was under the impression that it would track my strokes and distance to detect when each 50 meter was complete, and then automatically begin the next rep (lap) and so forth. Now, I’m brand new to this app, so I’m hoping I’ve done something wrong or am misunderstanding the set up of a custom workout. But I feel like people looking to purchase this app should know that you’ll need to interrupt your swimming each rep to tell the app you’ve completed a rep (lap) and are ready to begin the next rep (lap). That, and you should add in a few seconds to each interval to make time for your manual entrees, and turn off the auto water-lock so that your not wasting further time spinning the watch crown after each manual entry. I’m so bummed about this. I really wanted something fluid and on-track.\\n\\nUpdate: so if you scroll down when creating a custom workout, select record splits and tell it how long you anticipate each lap to be and it’ll auto-advance to the next programmed rep/set/group/lap. The tracking of meters already swam is still not 100% accurate unfortunately, but with all the other features this app offers its okay in my opinion. What makes up for it is that the apple watch records the meters swam in the background and I’m able to know the true distance I’ve swam. Unfortunately, when you make a custom workout, whether you’ve completed the full workout or not, it gets logged in your activity as fully completed whether you’ve swam that full distance or not, lol 😂 this may be great for some people.---------Learn how the App Store works: offer free introductory resources. If they’re good enough, I and others will buy/upgrade. Don’t require people to pay in order to see the first thing.---------Encountered a lot of bugs and not many plan options---------This app worked at the beginning of the year and is now completely broken.---------I mostly do open water ocean swimming, I used this app 4 times and all four times and lost my swims. I will not pay hundred dollars a year for an app that doesn’t work!---------Virtually no free content. If you want to charge for the app just charge for the app. Don’t make it seem like there’s even bare bones functionality.---------I ask For The password reset many of times and I don’t get the email. I just tried to change it and nothing! HELP!---------I bought a 1 year membership and used it for the first time and didnt record my swim session, then i contact cuatomer support and was useless , hence i cancelled my year membership---------This app used to be good before you had to pay hundreds of dollars to build a CUSTOM workout.---------Nothing is available unless you purchase elite version of the app.---------Does not appear to give FREE workouts to non members. Also very bother some ads along with bother some emails.---------Nothing worth while unless you pay. Unreasonably expensive and never ending.---------It’s a free app, but you have to buy everything to be able to actually use the program. 😪👎🏼🤦\\u200d♀️---------App freezes after hitting end workout.  Attempts to restart watch don’t help; the workout is not logged.---------With the update to Apple Watch iOS 9, SwimPro is now more inaccurate than ever before! I’ll just be using the Apple app for lap swimming.---------Useful for recording race times---------The watch app on my Fitbit will not load anything. Please fix.---------The app keeps crashing and is very expensive for such a bad app---------WAYYYYY TOO EXPENSIVE. I am not paying 120 dollars a year for this app. Also you pretty much can’t do anything if you have the free version except look at the thumbnails of the workouts.---------In order to access any workouts you must become a member at $20 a month---------The App Store advertises this app as having free workouts but it does not. You have to pay for everything. I was very disappointed.---------I love this app but it keeps sticking/freezing when I rev my workouts….please fix it---------Lots of fun and tons of content. 5 stars!---------I just wanna be noticed---------I get only bun and no meat unless I signup for $9.99/month. I can see what’s offered, but there doesn’t seem to even any sample content. Useless.---------This app fails to actually track what I do in the pool with my wearOS watch. Not worth the money, given this app’s lack of tracking. Workouts are good though.---------Wont allow me to make my own workout sets UNLESS I PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION---------You have to pay for literally everything ugh 🙄---------I never did manage to finish my swimming season in my Apple Watch 5. Disappointing---------Do not use!  Free trial doesn’t even include work out plans.  I wasted 30 min trying to find them---------Waits until you enter your data and then forces you to subscribe to a $179 plan per year---------I download the app and signed up for the free trial and none of the plans I selected worked.---------Off to a great start in pool and dry land. Love the app---------Former collegiate swimmer. I just need fresh workout ideas. Wasted my time with the download, not paying for workouts!---------Free version too limited. Premium Paid version too expensive.---------I absolutely love this app. I\\'ve been using it throughout the summer, and it\\'s been helpful with planning sets when I\\'m working out in my own. Although the app requires monthly payments in order to access all sets/workouts, it also offers a week-long free trial, and I think the payments are worth the way it has helped me to develop my technique, speed, and distance. It even provides videos with commentary for the drills. I highly recommend MySwimPro for all swimmers, the novice and experienced alike. My only complaint is, when exporting workouts to pdf for printing, sometimes the longer workouts get cut off. I hope this bug will be fixed with later updates.---------I would like this app if it wound work.---------The app is prettier, but bring out more metrics already. Strokes per minute is a must---------Impossible to use---------Too much updates guys!!---------It is not accurate at all.---------I like using this app but cannot afford a subscription.---------Don’t waste your time.---------Nice, nice and 1 more nice for your great job moving all workouts to paid area. Keep it up!---------Don’t download unless you’re ready to pay $$---------Will not sync data.---------The app always fails to count my first lap properly. Very frustrating---------I’m taking it up with American Express ASAP. Super disappointed!!---------This app has nothing indicating that it is a subscription service. A very EXPENSIVE service.---------The keyboard will not get out of the way.---------I dont like this version!!!all plans want pay money!!! The recipe was free---------Zero free workouts. Such a waste of a download.---------NOT FREE!!---------PROS\\n1. It\\'s great having the workout right on the Apple Watch. This is a HUGE plus and the reason I downloaded the app. \\n\\n2. Also like how you can customize the workouts in the app or create your own which is what I did.\\n\\nOPPORTUNITIES \\n1. The app is buggy from the watch. Tested it 2x before actually getting in the water with the app. Both time noticed it saved to my activity app twice. The second time, I let the app run for about a minute, it said I completed the full workout and approximately 300+ calories were burned. When I used the app in the pool that night, after completing my workout it posted as two different workouts with completely different avg times that were about 1:30 minutes off. Having been tracking myself with the Apple activity app since the watch came out, I went with the time closest to what I\\'d been doing.\\n\\n2. I\\'m not sure the app locks the Watch in swim mode as the icon didn\\'t show up. This is something I\\'ll actively do with my next swim to see what happens.\\n\\n3. Not in love with scrolling the crown to pause. This feels slower than the native two tap built into Apple activity.\\n\\n4. While my avg was transferred to the Apple activity app, I don\\'t have my splits. Guessing this is a paid feature? Kind of a bummer as this is native to Apple\\'s activity app.\\n\\nWill swim with this a few more times before deciding to keep or not. As of now, wouldn\\'t purchase.---------Before I started using MySwimPro I would just swim laps back and forth. I didn\\'t see much improvement in my swimming. Coming from not much experience of how to train in swimming I\\'d normally have to pay $$ for a trainer/coach. MySwimPro allows me to pick workouts specifically targeting what stroke I want, what distance pool I\\'m swimming in, and how much time I have to swim. The best part is being able to track how much I\\'m swimming and the improvement I\\'m making.\\n\\nMySwimPro is truly my swim coach. I can see it improving with each update, just as it helps me improve with each swim. Thank you MySwimPro.---------I use the app with my Apple Watch and it\\'s great for keeping track of my sets and times without having to worry about coming up with workouts or to keep track of laminated pages. There were issues with the app freezing and not tracking workouts properly but that seems to have been fixed with recent updates. My big complaint is still the price of the app. There are a very limited amount of free workouts and the rest is only unlocked with a subscription service of $20 a month or $100 for a year. Which seems like a bit much---------I\\'ve tried a lot of apps for swimming, but most are rather like a log book. I like that MySwimPro makes good use of the iWatch (I have a Series 2) and sets log automatically. Best, however, is that I dont have to plan my swim sets. I can just chose one and start swimming. I\\'m still getting used to tweaking the rest periods between sets. \\nI\\'ve recently upgraded to Premium and the developers have promised a few upgrades to come out soon. Last, but not least, the developers are very quick to respond and react to my issues/feedback.---------LOVE THIS APP AND WHAT ITS DONE FOR OUR WORKOUTS.\\n\\nMy group has swam together for 4 years. Our age ranges from 42-52. Our swimming ability ranges from intermediate to expert. Some of us actively compete in triathlons, others just swim to stay in shape. This app has been responsible for bringing new life to our workouts. We love the variety of stroke work, distance, sprints. The videos have helped us understand proper technique and the \"log\" allows us to see what we have accomplished and helps us feel even better about what we do each day in the pool. The app keeps getting better. USE IT, you\\'ll like it 😬---------Swimming with this is great. I really like how it records your swims and pausing is nice (you turn the crown a certain amount.) It counts your strokes and it does well with heart rate recording. You can load workouts which can be beneficial, but you have to pay for all the available workouts (not really a minus, just good business.)\\n\\nOne thing I wish the app had was Strava support. I\\'m a triathlete and I would really like to have a social app hub for all my activities. This is great for swimming, but the info just stays on their servers (and on Apple\\'s Activity app, but I don\\'t really count that.)---------I use this app every time I swim laps. I have a life proof case so that my phone can be poolside and I can click through all the sets as I go. I like the edit button and use it to make changes depending on how I feel that fat - maybe deleting or adding a rep to the main set. I make up my own workouts too with the \"new\" workout button, but I prefer to use their workouts.  My only complaint would be that I wish there were better freestyle workouts- they are very \"pull\" heavy and can be tough on the shoulders. My favorites are the IM workouts because of the variety.---------So far, I am really impressed with the app.  You are able to pick from a number of different workouts, ranging from individual stroke work to sprint or distance training.  The workouts they provide are full workouts, including warm ups, pre sets, main sets and cool downs.  They\\'re real deal workouts.\\n\\nThey also provide access to a articles and videos that have been really helpful.  Just a note, not all of the workouts are free.  There is a monthly subscription to get full access.---------I started swimming a few years ago after my orthopedist recommend that I give up running. I had no idea how to structure personalized workouts until I found myswimpro. The workout library is great and easy to use, and the metrics help me keep track of my progress over time. With a new structured workout routine, I noticed that I started to build more muscle and cut down on my waste line. I also just upgraded to premium and I can say it\\'s totally worth it! Best swimming app on the market!!---------The app has crashed a few times on me, but overall I\\'ve concluded that you can\\'t find a better app to log swims. I\\'ve recommended it to all my teammates. Logging swims is very simple (however, I\\'m not sure if the calorie tracker is entirely accurate--it seems a bit high). I also love how dedicated the app\\'s creators are. I receive occasional emails from them with practical swimming tips, and they regularly update the app with improvements.\\nOverall, I highly recommend this app.---------But I do wish there was a place to put the desired workout time. As in approximately 30 minutes, 60 minutes, etc. The ability to add/remove parts of the workout help with this, but still wish there was a button to hit so the app can give me a good workout for the amount of time I have.---------Our entire family uses this app whenever we can\\'t swim with our team. There\\'s something for everyone at every level, and you can emphasize any stroke (or IM) in your workout. It\\'s easy to print out your workout, and it gives you the total distance and time it\\'ll take. The sets make sense and the send-offs are perfect for each level. It\\'s intuitive to use and fast. LOVE this app!---------When I first downloaded the app, it was very helpful and was easy to use. When I updated the app to its latest version, I experienced multiple issues when logging my workouts. For instance, when entering the intervals, it will always go back to one minute. If you wish to edit the set you just entered, when you tap on it, the app crashes- not saving anything. I love using this app as it tracks my swimming but, the update has made it stressful and annoying.---------In the last May update, when the watch touches the water the screen goes back to the clock app and MySwimPro does not record the distance. If you can eventually make it stay on the screen, there is no way to end and log your workout; the time keeps going and it says \"Ending workout...\" until you delete the app and reinstall it.---------As a former college swimmer this app has helped me stay in shape and even prepare for season while I was still swimming. I love that I can track my progress, pick from a variety of sets, and customize my workouts to my ability.  The videos are helpful, especially for those just getting into swimming.  The new update is great with more set options. Definitely recommend!---------I swim once a week. I\\'m a pool scrub, 800m and I\\'m toast. Working on getting better and looking for an app to help. This does with some videos and other training sundries. Unfortunately 80% of the app is behind a subscribe monthly wall which is far outside my appetite.\\n\\nAlso some bugs in editing swims. No matter what I edit. It saves the default program unless it is custom from the ground up. \\n\\nGood stats screen and glad to see something enter the arena but the pricing model will eventually push me away.---------I was able to get my times to sync from USMS, but the page to view top times doesn\\'t load correctly. 9/10 times it gets frozen or something and doesn\\'t display any events or corresponding times. It also seems a little tedious to enter workout info. I don\\'t want to keep track of every set, just the overall distance and strokes used. Please fix the bugs and make the interface easier to use!---------I just started back swimming laps and using my new Apple Watch. I like the features of my swim pro, it does show the different strokes. I usually swim 200 yd sets. 200 free, 200 back then 200 breast. How do I get the app to register the different strokes. If I swim without stopping at the end of a set, the app reports free. I have tried to pause between sets, then the app stops and doesn\\'t register the next set. The app has even gone inactive and not recorded the session.---------I have been using this app for a couple of weeks now and I have had very positive results with it. \\n\\nEasy to use, and with very helpful mini tutorials for strokes and techniques that help achieve proper form and overall ability to achieve a professional workout. \\n\\nHighly recommend.---------I love this app! I use it if practice ever gets canceled. I\\'ll write down the set, take it to the pool, and when I get back I log my swim! Maybe in the next update, there could be a feature where you can save the workout and edit the times you have to make. Great app, 5 stars!---------I have high hopes for this app.  Would love to see the option to input my 100yd base interval.  The selection of beginner, intermediate, advanced seems too broad a bucket and I have no way of knowing if the workout intervals are designed for lots of rest or if I should manually drop the times.  Having heart rate data is great, but would like to see that used to help coach the appropriate workouts and intervals.  Thanks!---------If I could rate the app for the watch part probably a solid 3.5 stars 4 when you factory in the possibilities under future updates. But the phone part of the app is just off NO METRICS for anything really if you use a garmin swim watch 920xt or better or anything like that you will be disappointed to not find any of your stoke count, swolf report, or even pace per individual interval... glad I could unsubscribe immediately.---------I\\'m a lifeguard and at my job we are required to swim a lot. I  try to swim more so I can increase my strokes and to stay fit. This is a great app! However I wish there was a way to upload our own workouts so that I wouldn\\'t have to pay for majority of them.  But it\\'s a nice overall.---------Videos! Downloadable workouts! Stroke differentiation and auto-pause. Sure looks good and promises a lot. The problem is you can\\'t actually start workouts from your Watch. Will hang indefinitely waiting for you to open one on your phone, which it won\\'t recognize. Plus, the website is not optimized for mobile at all.\\n\\nFor 9.99, this app should be flawless. For the obscene subscription price of 9.99 a MONTH, having any issues at all is an insult.---------I am a swimmer who was looking for an app that would help me improve and track all aspects of my performance and MySwimPro really delivered. It provides challenging workouts and I already can feel my stroke improving. I would recommend MySwimPro to anyone looking to improve their swimming.---------I did my first workout but where is my data?  Also it took about ten laps for it to start recording my laps accurately.  I have gone online to try to figure out how to sync the iwatch with the app on the iPhone - nice looking blog site but does not share anything about using the iwatch or the app.  The app on the iwatch was short on instructions so i had no idea how to end the workout or save it.---------Every single day I use this app it grows on me. Tracking workouts/stats/progress is very rewarding. Having followers helps drive accountability. Follow others to see what workouts your friends are doing. Double bonus with the large library of custom workouts.---------Was having problems with the app crashing, but that is fixed in most recent version of the app. Overall, I like the workouts and have seen improvements to my times using this app for training. \\n\\nDevelopers are pretty responsive and open to feedback. \\n\\nI still see issues with mismatches in the distance reported by the app (say 2000 yards) vs the distance that is reported in Apple\\'s activity app (1750 yards) for the same workout. It seems like the activity app doesn\\'t count drills?\\n\\nI\\'d love to see the app get smarter about rest time. If I always finish a set well below the suggested time then it should adjust.---------I downloaded the app registered with an email all that jazz. Decided I should test this out. Followed all the steps on the Apple Watch and in the end not one stroke of one lap was recorded! Then I check my email to make sure I registered and then went to the website to write a comment, maybe I did something wrong. And the email won\\'t send from the website. To say I\\'m disappointed is the understatement of the week. Hope they reach out.---------It looks like all the pieces are here to benefit from integration with the Apple Watch series 2 but yet falls way short. Could only sink watch and app 1 x and couldn\\'t even get work outs on the watch. Please fix the series 2 watch and app interface. Also the monthly cost is high in my opinion less than $5.00 a month is a more appropriate price point if everything worked (IMO).  Please fix and you will have a new customer.---------This app works great! I have checked it out, and everything is flawless! The amount of opportunities are endless (and for free, too)! I think it\\'s so cool how you can get customized workouts, down to the very last detail. Thank you for making this app!---------I got injured and couldn\\'t run for several months. This app helped me get through weeks of cross training with lots of different workouts, goals and new drills. I like having an exact plan to follow. Thanks for videos and definitions.---------It doesn\\'t track your distance when you are kicking and doesn\\'t account for long streamlines, so the distances end up off when you\\'re done with a set, sometimes by quite a bit. My workouts are typically about 1,000 yards longer than the app indicates. \\n\\nIt\\'s okay and it probably does the most it can for what it is able, but I was expecting more.---------This app is awesome for those who like to train by themselves or  for those who need help creating swimming workouts! I\\'m a triathlete and needed some help creating a training set!---------It freezes on my apple watch about twice in a 2 hour swim session. The mobile app also crashed multiple times when I would try to create workouts. Also, there\\'s no way to create workouts for later, so you would have to create your workout right before you swim.---------I would much rather use a specialized app like this over native Watch (ser. 2) swim tracker.  But i don\\'t have time in a.m. to mess with a crashing app, and i don\\'t want to risk paying for premium with no improvement in stability. What\\'s going on?  The reviewers are killing you, so let us know that you see the problem and know how to fix it.---------Super app, it’s full of helpful information, tips and recommendations. I have just started to use it and already got first results. I improved my swimming speed by using the right technique.---------I do love this app, I use it for every time I go swimming, but after I recently updated it, it deleted all of my recent swims.  It only saved all of the ones 30 weeks old or older.  It\\'s a little aggravating because of all the work I\\'ve put in, but I\\'ll continue to use it regardless…---------This app is sweet. The best part is I can get individualized training based on my goals not just a generic set of workouts. Still experimenting with the options but video instructions are great as well. Thx!---------This app has changed the way I train. I used to be mediocre but this app helped me improve to levels I didn\\'t think were possible.---------I began swimming after stress injuries from running. This breaks down the workouts and gives great structure to my swims. Highly recommend for anyone looking to get more out of their pool time.---------I\\'m a super novice, so this app was a godsend helping me walk through what to do and get an actual workout from my swimming instead of flopping about! Very easy---------Once I figured out that I needed to manually allow the app to access data obtained from the watch, it worked great. Might want to make that component more straightforward.---------I have used the app on the apple watch series 2 for open water swims twice. Both times the app was very accurate and gave me calories and average heart rate which was great. But once the workout is done, the only place I can find stats is in the activity app on the watch/phone - no stats added to the swim pro app on my phone or watch. It\\'s as if I never swam.---------This app is revolutionary! I love my FitBit and this app is basically the equivalent of it for swimmers! It\\'s really easy to use and it will only get better I\\'m sure. Totally worth the download!!---------No review yet. Hope to get one soon. Just curious .. I have the series 2 Apple Watch. Am I able to actually exercise while swimming and take my Apple Watch with me while doing this ?---------Before the update and all the premium(we need to gouge money from folks) this was a fantastic app. It would still be one of it were a one time pay app, but to lock up all the variety and hold it hostage is crap. Guess I will be heading back to the web and creating my own once again.---------I wanted to find a swimming activity tracker with a few more features than the built-in Apple version in the watch. This is the second such alternative app that I tried, but its distance tracker is stuck at 0m and it doesn\\'t pause or restart the chronometer automatically, making it the worst of the bunch so far. I have no idea how it got the \"best app\" distinction.---------I use this app with my Apple Watch every time I swim now. It works great and is a useful tool in keeping track of workout while swimming. Keep up good work!---------I appreciate the commitment to make improvements which make this increases are use help for my swimming.---------Great for recreational use!! The simplicity of the app makes it easy enough for anyone to use and benefit from.---------This is a great app for beginners who don\\'t know how to structure a workout. I like the fact that it breaks down your workout in a circle graphic.\\n\\nIt also tells you approximate calories burned.\\n\\nYou can choose from the many workouts in a specific area you want to work (sprint, distance) or create your own personalized workout.\\n\\nExcellent app, keep it up myswimpro!---------So simple and easy to use. Videos are very informational and sets are challenging. Definitely recommend for everyone.---------I\\'ve been always intimidate by the pool and swim training. This app helps me feel like confident when approaching the swim lanes with purpose and knowing what to do.---------This app has allowed me not only to track my workouts, but progress as a swimmer---------This is an amazing app with cool features. It has great workouts and is an easy way to keep track our your practices.---------I have used this for 4 months and it is horrible.\\nIt does not track your first 25/50. Ever\\nIt has now started doubling my distance if I pause. Upon restarting - doubles.\\nIf you swim between 25 and 50 get ready to click 250 times to change. Yup. Standing on deck click click click click. You get it.\\nI\\'m done. Checking out a new one.---------I have tried six or seven upgrades over the last two months, and they all either crash, freeze, or do not work on the Applewatch, Apple iPhone and iPad. The developer has been very responsive and always returns emails, but the program just does not work unfortunately.---------Used it once before the last two updates and now it won\\'t even open on my watch. Was hoping the most recent update would fix it, but alas, it did not. :(---------I like the look and ease of using the app, but I want to export the workouts and print them off it does not allow me to go back to the previous screen. Very frustrating.---------This app is great for beginner through advanced swimmers looking for a great swim workout. Plus the company is responsive and looking for new ways to add to the app!---------You have to pay in order to get any of the workouts. It\\'s free to log your own, but I was looking to get new ideas to mix up my workouts. $100 a year or $15 a month is a bit much. But if you have the money...go for it.---------Please add a category for a swimmer with strong skills but low cardio that is trying to get back into the sport. Thanks!---------The latest version does not accurately track distance.  After trying a half dozen times, I have given up on this app. The Apple Watch activity tracker is far more accurate in a simultaneous comparison.  Such a shame that the App of the year for Watch is no longer functional.---------The strange issue I experience is that every swim is always logged twice in my health data.---------Low rating for this version only. Otherwise great app to track swims.---------The practices provided on the app are nowhere close to the level of training we do on a daily basis. My team practices around 11,000 yards a day, for 4+ hours total. Also,  a dryland section would be nice,---------The app cannot discriminate strokes. It turns off frequently in the middle of sets. It does not register rest, instead adding it to your pace. It often fails to register individual sets instead calling your 10x100\\'s im, \"1000 FR on 18 min.\" The native workout app on the watch works better, hands down.---------The only improvement I would suggest is adding option for swim/ drill, stroke/drill, kick/ swim, etc for 50s and some combos for 75s.---------Very impressed with the design and layout! Eager to hit the pool and generate some data! iOS 9.0.1 User---------The best swim coach you ever had any time. Easy to use and great workouts!---------I\\'d love to test this app out using my Apple Watch Series 2, but the watch app quits out immediately if I choose an open water swim.  I certainly will not pay $9.99 a month for an app that quits when I try to use it.---------This would be a great app if it wasn\\'t so misleading. You get a few limited workouts and then are teased that more are available, but you can\\'t access them if you don\\'t pay a whopping $9.99 per month to subscribe. Deleting this app.---------I used it today and it didn\\'t track anything! Only the time I was in the pool. I was out of range of my phone but that shouldn\\'t affect the watch not tracking any yards. Does anyone else know why it didn\\'t work for me?---------Easy to use, lots of great workouts...demo videos are a cool feature too!---------Twice the app quit mid workout. And when it was tracking the yardage was inaccurate. I did not bump the watch. I just checked it midswim and it had quit. I hope you can improve it. I am done with it for now.---------Great App. When I can\\'t swim with my USMS team due to work / life, this allows me various workouts to come up with.  Thank you!!!---------Seems like a great app, but it always crashes. Even worse, you think you have it working once you start laps, only to get out of the pool and seeing that it crashed mid workout.---------This app helped me improve my swimming and meet my fitness goals! Very useful and great design.---------Attempted to use and ended up with a watch screen asking if I would like to pause my swim. Unable to leave this page. Had to uninstall. \\nCan not recommend.---------I selected the advanced level and all of the workouts were way too easy. If you come from a competitive swimming background this app will be a waste of time.---------Workout time goes back to 0 in the summary a couple seconds after showing the actual time. Crashes halfway through the workout.!!!!!---------Anyone looking for great swimming workouts will find this app very useful.---------You have to pay if you want to unlock certain strokes. Usually workout apps you pay to get advice from a trainer, or to log things, not to unlock individual exercises...---------This is a superb app!---------It\\'s almost as if this app was created by the gods themselves. Truly revolutionary. Just...wow.---------This is the best swimming app on the AppStore! Look no further! You are done!---------App constantly crashes during my workouts. I brought the issues I was having to the attention of the CEO. Still doesn\\'t work.---------App looks great on first glance but the option to turn off auto renew seems to be no where in sight.---------Awesome workout app! It\\'s like having a coach anytime, anywhere.---------I installed this app on my Apple Watch Series 2, after swimming multiple laps this app shows 0 for everything :(---------Can\\'t understand. \\n\\nI started workout and the apple watch didn\\'t lock the water switch.---------I never got a chance to use this because every time I tried opening the app, it froze, then crashed.---------Apple Watch cannot open this program. Video cannot play, don\\'t now how this app works. It looks like only the payment part is working.---------Finally, a great Apple Watch swimming app! Premium has a free trial that I love!---------Hands down best app on the app store for swimming---------Don\\'t waste your time it crashes every time. You will finish swimming and nothing is tracked.---------Good to add to workouts in the off season---------I have an iPhone 7 and Apple Watch series 2. Would think this featured app would work on the newest gadget but can\\'t even get it to start.---------Absurdly overpriced cash grab from an App that offers very little.\\n\\nSwim Workouts and videos are available for free online, and the metrics pale in comparison to what Garmin offers for free. Where\\'s my SWOLF? Where\\'s my stroke rate?---------This app is awesome. I wish I installed it earlier!---------I found that the Apple Watch build in workout app is much better than this one.---------5 stars awesome!---------Great information and tutorials. The application crashed on me while I was in mid workout.---------Why can\\'t these apps work without knowing your Facebook or email?  Not worth it.---------I think they should just show the fee for the app. It might be a good app, but it\\'s not for free.---------Crashed the first time I used it and wiped out 30 minutes of lap swimming. Then I used it again and swam for 20 minutes. It recorded just 129 yards.---------This app appears utterly useless unless you pay tons of money every month. This app is strictly for the rich swimmer. Useless.---------I hate this app. I want a simple swim tracker. (Swim IO, for instance, is great but doesn\\'t synchronize with Apple Watch). The phone app UI is convoluted. Data entry is confusing. And manual entries don\\'t appear in the activity app.---------2 swims in 2 days. 2 total fails. App crashes after 30 minutes of swimming. It was consistent in crashing!---------The app crashes when I try to view my feed or add a workout locally.---------I\\'m swimming at home in a 45 foot pool.  No ability to customize pool length?  So the app will just assume I\\'m turning laps at record pace?  Stupid. It\\'s a non-starter.---------It\\'s amazing I love it---------Heart rate not working nor gps.  Very disappointed---------Suggest to find another app to train. Everything based on in-app purchases---------Beyond that I didn\\'t investigate the app since I swim in a 50\\' pool.---------Not sure if it\\'s the app, or the watch.  Didn\\'t track laps/yards.  Stayed at 0.---------Swam for 30 minutes with Series2 watch....0 yards.  what the heck?---------Help me.---------App is just waste of time and money.---------I don\\'t know where to begin. \\n\\nFirst of all, I love the idea of the app. I use to be a competitive swimmer and am familiar with creating a workout and timing, and blah blah. \\n\\nThat being said, this app completely misses the bar, at least right now. \\n\\nRight to it:\\n\\n• No clear way to create a custom workout and save it for future use without paying for the full membership. (This is enough for me to completely stop using the app.)\\n\\n• 1/3 of the way thru my workout the watch app crashes and returns to the beginning of the workout when restarted. \\n\\n• The force touch unlocking feature doesn\\'t register the first 2 times I try to do it. That is after you\\'ve tapped it five times to turn the screen on. All the while costing you 10-15sec when all you wanted to do was pause the workout. \\n\\n• The app (specifically with the use of the Apple Watch) could really use a \"Lap\" button to track times of non interval-time sets or a \"Rest\" button that you can set for a designated (10sec.) rest time after or in-between sets. \\n\\n• I expected the ability to track the time of sets; not the case. You just get the over time it took you to complete the whole workout. Very basic. \\n\\n• The Watch app could really use a back button too; to go back to the previous set. I accidentally clicked \"Next Set\"...there was no going back, except starting all over again. \\n\\n• There is no indication between what sets you have completed. So, if you end your workout early the whole workout will be shown regardless of where you stopped. This is where split times of each set would come in handy. \\n\\nI hope this gets better.---------This app is cool.---------It’s a great app! I wish the yearly cost would go down a bit but I like it. It’s really helped me improve my swimming and help make me stronger. One of my problems is that I don’t have a 6 digit code come up on my watch, though I don’t know if the problems from the app or my watch. If I could get an answer that would be nose. Overall I’d give this app a 4 star rating.---------VERY limited in practical application. Not recommended.---------It\\'s a great app because it\\'s the only swimming app for Apple Watch.\\nIt\\'s a very mediocre app for its capabilities. \\nIts only usefulness can be found for encouraging complete beginner swimmers to maintain a consistent workout scheme. \\n\\nThe free version of the app gives you heart rate, distance swam, estimated calories burnt and that\\'s about it. The paid version (which will cost you a hefty $100 a year minimum) will give you more graphs about how your workout consistency and... well, estimated analytics of your swimming. \\n\\nTo make short, the app doesn\\'t do anything else important than justify the water resistance of the Watch 2 and log your swimming sessions. You have to tell beforehand what stroke you\\'re swimming and the only thing the app detects is basically the distance traveled. It\\'s advertised as a revolutionary app that will make you a great swimmer, but the pretty layout of the menus are simply not enough. \\n\\nAs a competitive swimmer, this app is completely useless to me and would be for any even barely experienced swimmer. \\n\\nComplete beginners will find it useful as it encourages consistency in workouts and advice on how to improve strokes etc... If you pay the $100 yearly subscription.\\n\\nAll in all very disappointed. I also have the Moov 2 wristband that provides with extreme accuracy in stroke detection, distance per stroke, precise times for each length, flip-turns etc... I was hoping to get the equivalent with this app for my Apple Watch but I will be sticking with my $60 wristband that actually gives me plentiful accurate feedback on my sessions.---------Not a very good app. It has the potential to be one but the execution is just lacking. For instance, I tried to create an interval training workout that included some set intervals and some open interval sets and I just couldn\\'t figure out a way to make it happen. This despite seeing that they created such workouts in the pre-configure workout area.\\n\\nWorse yet, the watch app simply lost my data 3/4 of the way through a long workout. I was swimming along, checked the app and the watch had flipped back to the watch screen. When I reopened the app on the watch I just started all over again and that data was completely lost. The phone was not connected at the time because I left it in the car and do not have any interest in risking having my phone stolen at the gym. This type of app behavior is unacceptable and I will not be using it again.\\n\\nFinally, the website is garbage. Yes it\\'s pretty, but its sole purpose is to sell the app and team to investors. I couldn\\'t find any helpful instructions, tips, or anything else that would benefit me as a user. I did learn about the \"team\" responsible for creating the app and *importantly* that the CEO is a serial entrepreneur who has 3 successful exits out of 5 startups [gag]. Apparently they also won an apple design award for the watch app, although it doesn\\'t seem like there\\'s much competition.\\n\\nHopefully your luck is better than mine but I\\'m going to steer clear of this app until its revised a few more times. And that\\'s just for the free app. There\\'s no way I\\'d pay that huge subscription rate for this app, even though I don\\'t mind paying for software.---------THIS APP IS DOPE!---------would most likely be a good app except for the fact that you can\\'t do anything without a subscription im 14 years old and don\\'t have $179.99 to spen in an app all i need to use is the dryland again seems like a really good app and has really good customer service but it\\'s not for me (sorry if i offended anyone with this review)---------This app finally got me back in the pool, after a ten-year hiatus. The workouts are interesting, go by quickly, and I’m so pleased to see real progress. When I was trying to swim without it, I was doing maybe 1000-1500k but I’m back at 3-4K workouts, like I did in high school. Just did my first dryland workout and I like the format of that, too! I recommend it to all the swimmers in my life :)---------I started swimming 4 years ago at the age of 50 and stumbled upon this app through the YouTube videos that taught me how to swim. For 2+ years I put off paying the “extra” money for the coaching and other features available. Now that I did purchase the coaching, I have ZERO regrets. My technique has improved and the workouts have taken the boredom out of just swimming laps. The integration with my Apple Watch is seamless and the support team has been very responsive whenever I have notice a potential bug. The quarterly coach sessions are also very motivational. Thanks to the entire SwimPro team!!!---------I’m writing this on the first day of the free seven day trial, and it’s not going well. I found several bugs that make it impossible to use the app. For example under settings if I tap “Apple TV” it put me into a dialog box where it wanted a confirmation code, but I don’t have an Apple TV, so I can’t get that code. And there’s no way to cancel or back out of this dialog – I had to force quit the app and restart it. It also hung when I tried to enter my best lap times, with another force quit. Then when I tried one of the guided workouts at the pool, it was going OK, but then the workout just stopped without logging anything. I restarted the workout (which was really slow on the watch, I had to tell it to skip each lap individually to get back to where I was) and then it happened again a few laps later, so I gave up on the workout and just used the built-in Workouts app, which worked really well as usual. I’ll keep trying and update this review tomorrow if things improve. I gave the app 2 stars because at least they give you a chance to see that it doesn’t work without having to commit to a year’s subscription. ******************************************** Update for day 2: today I was able to get all the way through the workout without the watch app crapping out. And the workout was good — the little videos explaining how to do the drill sets were useful, and the structured workout felt great. But after the workout, I noticed that it clobbered my Activity rings — even though it said I have a mile walk plus a mile swim recorded, it also said I have burned 0 calories, have 0 minutes of exercise and have 0 stand hours logged today (rebooting the watch mostly fixed this, though I’m still missing some minutes.) So I raised my review to 3 stars, but I still feel the app is way too buggy to justify paying for. ******************************************** Update for day 3: Did another workout during the trial period today. When I was 1300 yards into it, the watch app just stopped tracking the workout again. This time I saw it happen — I was in the rest period between sets, and the blue app icon appeared in the middle of the screen, the white dots circled around it for a second or two, and then I was dumped back to the menu. While I was able to get back to the point I was at (which took 5 minutes because I had to advance through every single rep one by one… which required turning off the water lock every single rep! It’s enough to make me turn off auto-lock) and finish the workout, the data for those first 1300 yards was completely gone. This kind of data loss is just unacceptable — incremental progress saves have been a thing in consumer software for decades, at most I should lose the most recent rep. Having a “resume workout” button, or at least let me scroll through the workout to a specific point, would be better UX. But at least it didn’t clobber my activity rings this time! I did leave my phone in the locker room today, which I wonder might help avoid the issue… the previous workout that didn’t crash out did have the phone in range. But nevertheless, my opinion is the same — 3 stars and WAY too buggy to justify a $30 a month subscription. ********************************************\\nUpdate for day 4: Today I tried to do my fourth workout of the free trial period.  Got 600 yards into it and the workout crapped out again — this time I had my phone in range, so that wasn’t the reason it worked that one time.  It happened between reps 2 and 3 of a set, and the watch was waterlocked, so there shouldn’t have been anything I could do to accidentally cancel it. It’s clear that MySwimPro was written by MyProgrammingAmateur. (Heh, renaming this review to that.) I just gave up on the workout after that, lowered the review score to 2 stars again, and have cancelled the free trial subscription.---------I loved building workouts and saving them tweaking them and logging them. It looks like they put the ability to save a workout behind the paywall. I can build it but anytime I try to save it it is asking me to upgrade and won’t save it.  Update 7/14/22 a couple of updates ago they made the upgrade banner go from around a 1/4 inch tall to now taking up half my screen.  Maybe if you offered a lower tier pricing option just to create/save/log workouts people would jump at that. I really don’t need nor want the coaching help. I just want an app that I can create/save/log workouts---------Apple Watch Swim mode doesn’t  track kick drills. MySwimPro does.  It even reminds you if you forgot to switch into drill mode, (GPS😵\\u200d💫). Also, be careful pairing with Strava on Apple Watch. It’ll record the same workout twice.---------Fares Ksebati has great training material on YouTube. He is founder of MySwimPro.  \\n\\nThe free trial version is just a tease.  Shows you what you can get with the paid version. When you click the workouts and videos, you get the PAY NOW TO UPGRADE. Annoying, but people got to make a living. \\n\\nJust go to YouTube and watch the videos for free.---------Very disappointed. \\n\\n1. Won’t login on watch from phone. \\n2. Won’t send workout to watch.\\n3. Didn’t offer me any workouts that made sense. Offered beginners workout. I currently do 3000-3500 3x per week. Intervals made no sense.---------Don’t waste your time, they lead you to think it’s free, but it’s not.\\n\\nAnd if you do decide to start using it at $200 a year, they could increase rates in the future.\\n\\nI’m sure they will reply some of the prg is free, but all the useful beneficial parts are not, such as the videos to improve technique.\\n\\nSAVE YOUR $ AND WATCH FREE YOUTUBE VIDEOS!---------The first thing that pops up is a page telling you you have to pay over $100 to use the app. Outrageously priced given that I could just go on YouTube or google and find pretty much the same information and workouts that the app offers from free sites.---------I have gone through all the updates and swim 5-6 times per week. Logging from Apple Watch 2 has stopped. The info goes into my activity and HeartWatch apps but logging is not happening on the MySwimPro app itself! Cmon man! The social feed stuff is cute, but at least get the log to work for our own history so we can repeat workouts we like or improve on total workout times, etc before you bog my stuff down with cutsie social media fodder. Going on 2year premium user but have no qualms about going back to a ziplock with a printed workout.\\n\\n10-16-18 update. Logging seems to be fixed. Changed rating to 4 instead of 2 stars. I hope the main focus continues to be on the basic functionality working PERFECTLY in the midst of the desire to add more “neato” features.---------I have tried to cancel this app for months!!! Noting works - I keep getting an auto draft of $19.99 a month.  I do t have extra money or access to a pool right now due to COVID-19. I don’t have a job anymore or a gym or pool to even swim in!! Ridiculous that you will not stop drafting my account!!! This in my THIRD attempt to get the auto draft to stop.---------I hate giving this app a bad review, but how can I sync my Fitbit?\\nI’ve had this app on my Fitbit not knowing what to do until now. I got logged in and stuff, but I can’t sync. I don’t see a code on the app or anywhere. Please a developer or someone respond.---------Bait and switch. \\'Free app\\' but all it gives you is times and distances (eg 400M at X:00 time) If you want ANY kind of analytics - pace, SPL, SPM, etc - that\\'s premium. All the \\'coaching\\' and workouts - premium. Premium premium premium for ANY of the features. And that\\'s $10-20 a MONTH. FORGET IT! I\\'ll stick with free Swim.com or even Apple watch \\'activity\\' app w/ \\'pool swim\\' better than this. Garbage.---------Do not get this app!  It will work for a while and then refuse to load new workouts to your Apple Watch.  Very discounting for an app that costs $25 a month.  You might as well use the swim.com app, which is cheaper and works.---------I\\'ve used this app 3 times and all 3 times I got inaccurate lap counts. Seems to be way off the count by 800-900 yards. I usually swim 3500 to 4000 yards and it will only count 2600-3100 .. that\\'s a big difference. And yes I\\'m doing all the right things .. not stopping in middle of my\\nLaps, I make sure I have a good turn and push off. This morning I was finishing up a 3500 yard swim .. my lap count was 2600... I was doing my 100 yard cool down.. when I reached the end of my laps .. I noticed the app had crashed and I lost totally lost my swim.. needless to say I\\'m going to delete this app. Worthless!---------I downloaded the app to see if I could use it to start swimming for recreation. I didn’t like the set up or the workouts so I canceled the trial subscription. 14 days later I get hit with a charge of $109.00 for the year log subscription!---------App is useless. Cant even log in using email. Keep getting username/ password error. Customer service is horrible. Can log in website but that does me no good. What a waste!---------The worst,it is ten dollars a month just to unlock one stroke and that one stroke has one type of swim! A 1,000 it gives you a 500 freestyle to start off with.don\\'t get it it takes forever to download and it is a waste even buying the pro version. So mad!!! 😡😡😡😡😡'"

       "'After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.\\n\\nThe app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. \\n\\nI wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don\\'t appeal to me.  I just don\\'t understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.---------Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple’s UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the “X” should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  \\n\\nIn functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).\\n\\nLastly, this has a very social media feel to it in some places, especially as I was going through the privacy settings, so if that isn’t your thing (like it isn’t for me), make sure you turn your profile to private.---------They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets. \\n\\nStill, I do like the improvements they’ve made in the last few years. Keep working on it.---------At 70 yo I sometimes ( no, all the time) need motivation in these times to get up and do something healthy   Keeping track of my daily yardage and checking cumulative weekly, monthly and annual yards against others in similar age groups keeps me getting up early and driving daily to the Y.  Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.---------This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I’m part of a club team and we have “wall tap counters” (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you’re on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.---------Installed this app because I was looking for some better views on my watch of laps, time, heart rate, etc when swimming. The Apple Workout app wasn’t cutting it for me. The watch views are exactly what I was looking for but I noticed after a couple swims that my active calories are significantly under reported compared to the Apple app. When comparing heart rate data from other workouts it seems this app is under reporting rather than other apps over reporting. The difference is significant for a 30 minute workout, about half the reported calories.---------I want to like this app. It has potential, and I’ve stuck with it for the past three years. Unfortunately, the bugs are overwhelming. Even something as simple as drill mode, where the app doesn’t need to do anything except what it is told by the user, fails to record proper distance and time. Not to mention the latest “upgrade” to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn’t work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What’s more, half of the time the workouts don’t upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features. Make the app solid and reliable first, then focus on upgrades.---------I like this app because it’s the only one I know of that lets me edit back in my kick set yardage after the workout is done. There is no choice for a kick set in the editing section so I call them a drill. App worked well until recently then suddenly stopped uploading data to Apple health. After about one month an update was released and now everything is working properly again.---------Easy to use and manually add my yardage. I have a iWatch but can\\'t figure out how to use it with this site\\nWhen I click the Leaderboard, it only shows I\\'ve done 75yds so I\\'m obviously doing something wrong as my 3x per week swims are close to 7,500.  I\\'m 67 yrs of age and since covid pandemic have been away from synchronized swimming so loving the pool again \\nNot techi but at least I can manually enter my yardage\\nReported my pool as having changed names and it was quickly corrected!   Thank you!---------The new iPhone app format update is the worst user interface I\\'ve ever seen. Lots of wasted space with useless bar graphs and useless lifetime totals, difficult to see your last workout data, and hard to read it when you find it. And a new focus on offering workouts but if you don\\'t need them you\\'re going to have to constantly navigate around that. The Apple watch workout app shows the real data a million times better. Hopefully they\\'ll fix it because their Apple watch app is better than the workout one. \\n\\nLastly, still useful from an old review:\\nThere are no weekly totals, no analysis of improvement. If they improve all this stuff it could be useful.---------Communicated with John who was very helpful. App has always correctly recorded times for me for the almost two years that I’ve used it. But one swim recently showed correct total time but recorded each length as exactly same time - obvious error. John guided me through a few steps and consulted with his engineer. Problem seems to have fixed itself. I appreciated John’s concern and his checking in with me later to verify app was working fine now.---------This app is great when it works. Just after the new iOS update the app has been buggy and lost two of my swims. I️ like that it handles rest between intervals and sets. I️ also like to set the drill mode. The Apple Watch workout app tracks in the background and it adds to your rings.  Ending a workout can be a pain since the way the Apple Watch and app are relying on pressure. Did a 4000 yard workout with my masters group and the app locked up and lost the workout. It needs serious fixes and an update. May go back to apples fitness app which is harder to handle I️. The water for drill sets.---------I haven’t even gotten around to using this app in the pool because the interface/settings are extremely cumbersome. This app won’t save your preferences on workout searches; it defaults back to the preferences you input when you set up your account. I made the “mistake” of setting up preferences that turned out to be very restrictive and only showed one workout. If I want to search for a new workout, I have to change my preferences every time I navigate away from the Workouts tab. If I favorite a workout after fiddling with my preferences for the umpteenth time, I have to change my settings yet again when I want to view those workouts.---------Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line---------This app works. I am not sure where all the complaints come from. It counts laps, yards/meters, shows heart rate in one place. The new redesign on AW is just perfect. Especially the color coding. The stats on phone seems to be a little “cluttered” but still show all that is needed. This review comes from a guy with over 40 years of experience swimming. To developers, keep up the great work. Thanks!---------This has been happening to me in the past month at least one a week and I was hoping the new update would fix this but it happened again today and I lost all my data! I was doing a drill and I was ready to do my last 100 yards and I looked at my watch to check my pace and the app was back to the start as if I had not just swim 2500 yards.---------Only complaint is there’s no option to NOT put in distance. Sometimes I just swim for “time” and don’t count the distance. App requires a multiple to place in the distance box. I just put in a random number and then in the notes I explain what I did on this particular training day. Other than that, app is easy to use and very useful, especially for me as a “returning swimmer”, so I can measure my progress. Cheers!---------My primary complaint is that the last lap appears to throw in a couple of seconds. One can check this by comparing the splits against the last. Now to work around this problem, I simply add another 50 yards to the interval and use the next to last split and final times. And it makes a better workout!\\n\\nOne other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.\\n\\nYou are building a very good tool and our requests are a testimony that we’re using it but want more. Very common in the software business.\\n\\nAs I mentioned earlier I would be happy to pay for this app so don’t stop!\\n\\nAnd thank you!---------I’ve used this App for 4 years and over the last year it has been crashing and dropping my swims halfway through my 3500 yard sessions. I regularly have to check and manually add 1300+ yard sets to accurately track my total distance. I submitted a report and they told me it was because I’m not running the current version (which I am on an Apple Series 6). Unfortunately this is the best tracker I have found so far so I deal with the crashes that have become a regular part of my training.---------I like the app on the Apple watch 2 but doesn’t translate well to iPhone. The workouts usually take days to sync and the calories always show 0 even though my watch obviously picks up the movement. It just doesn’t equate to the same number of calories as the resistance brings when the watch knows that your swimming. Not sure I explained well but it’s frustrating. The only thing I like about his app is that it differentiates resting vs swimming time. Haven’t found another swimming app that does that automatically.---------More accurate than iSwimStat, and I compare it with a couple others but this doesn’t load quickly. It takes hours or even days to show up even though I refresh many times. Not sure if I’m using it correctly.  Synched with Apple Watch.---------I like this app - it’s free and you can’t argue with the value for what it does (other apps charge you for stats/membership). The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is my being unable to put/list myself on leaderboard. Perhaps it’s just a learning curve - I’m using this app only for a 3-4 months. Do you know how I can fix that?---------In my opinion, the best app. It stops automatically, you have the possibility to record distance swam for drill mode (apple watch native exercise app does not offer this possibilty), you have the possibility to swim a set in a fixed amount of time (repeat in), which is another important feature that the native app does not have).---------When it automatically syncs it is good but each year have problems with this. I love when it works correctly but not so much when it doesn’t. The service with issues of connectivity or syncing not much help. But it would be five stars if it worked correctly all the time.---------Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from regarding accuracy. This app comes within 50 yards of my 3000+ yard workouts, and gathers excellent data. The best part, however, is an easily accessible drill mode for kick sets. Best swim app available at time of this writing, and I’ve tried them all.---------After 3 years of using this app, I can say it covers all the needs of the swimmer and it keeps evolving and adding functionalities.\\n\\nUnmatched and highly responsive customer support makes it even better.---------I have used this app with my Series 2 Watch, and it worked well. The user interface is great, and accounting for kick drills is excellent. \\n\\nIt needs an update however for the new Watch iOS. I don’t blame the developer, but it needs to be addressed. Blows away Apple’s swim\\ntracker, when it works.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nI have uninstalled and then reinstalled. Still doesn’t work on Apple Watch Series 3. Developer is VERY responsive, which is appreciated, but still not working. Hopefully soon because it is an excellent app, when it works.\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE:\\n\\nI have done everything short of sacrificing a goat to get this app to work. I even reset my Apple Watch Series 3 to factory settings. After 200 meters, watch read 50. \\n\\nDone with this app forever. Great concept, but reality is much different. It just doesn’t work.---------I was really excited about this app, but it blocks out all relevant information and covers the face of my watch with just the time of day so it’s nearly impossible to figure out what my splits are or what comes next in the workout. I tried raising my arm, touching the screen, jiggling the Digital Crown, but nothing reliably called up the info I wanted to see. I finally gave up and went back to the watch’s built in lap tracker. Disappointing.---------Never had an issue with calorie transfer to health app until the recent update that was supposed to fix an issue regarding that. Said I burned 197,000 calories the first swim workout I completed since the new update. I have an Apple Watch 5 and iphone12 plus.---------Frequently adds laps, even for a 100 it may record 125. It also doesn’t correctly I’d strokes. Tech support doesn’t seem interested. I have the latest pre beta version with open water tracking, they told me all bugs were fixed. I use the latest “pre” beta version which I was told had the latest algorithms   Unfortunately I see the same errors as the previous versions---------Have nearly 900k yards tracked with only a handful of errors. Accurate tracking, consistent splits, and one button start/stop. On top of that, developers that listen and want to fix issues and constantly make this app better. Highly recommended.---------I had some issues with the Swim app on my Apple Watch a few years ago so I switched to Apple’s swim workout app -that is until Swim stopped loading the data (I think due to an Apple update)\\n\\nNow that I’m using Swim again, I notice two problems. \\n\\n1) the calories count is about half what it should be on my 2250 yard swim, but agrees with Apple’s count on my 250 yard swim. \\n\\n2) I typically do a long swim (2250 yds) followed by a short (250 yd swim). My last 2 sessions (using the Swim app on my Apple Watch 3) only one swim would load on swim. \\nOne time the app crashed when I ended the longer swim.---------This app is exactly what I wanted!\\n-build swim workouts\\n-track swim workouts\\n\\n4/5 stars because it’s very slow and communication with my Apple Watch is a bit glitchy. Couldn’t track this morning’s swim. Saw the update and downloaded it just now so hopefully that helps.---------I like the app and the ability to have my workouts on my Apple Watch.  The connection between the Watch and app does not work and when it does then the app to the activity tracker does not work.  I have followed all the suggestions in the support but it’s still unstable.  Connection to the internet is not the problem.---------Downloaded the app and tried to create a new account by putting all my info in, but I clicked on create new account nothing worked.---------The concept of the app is great and really needed as there is little support for swimmers.  I have had the app for a long time.  When it was launched I expected it would quickly start aligning with all the watches that support swimming metrics.  I support Polar who have been in the swimming space for a long time.  There is still no support for Polar or a raft of other watches.  If you want to grow your customer base surely appealing to a wider audience is a no brainer but I must be wrong!---------I bought my Apple Watch 6 last week. It only tracked 20 of 60 minutes in the pool. I’m starting out doing kickboard front/back crawls (no arms yet) and the tracking is wonky.\\n\\nI just want to track my laps. I’m looking for the swim lap tracker for dummies. I don’t think this is it yet. I’ll try for another week but I’ll be honest. I’m looking still.---------Some swim sessions are not being saved. Disappeared completely out of the box 😂\\nIt gets me frustrated, especially after swimming 4kms 🤯\\nThe new update of the app on the apple watch displays a weird layout sometimes, buttons and labels are getting outside of the screen 😳---------Great concept but the ease of use isn’t there. The app isn’t intuitive to use and is a bit behind the power curve when it comes to inputting your times. There is no option for tenths and it refers to your time as “duration.” I’m not thrilled with this at all. Did they use actual swimmers when running this thru testing? I can’t imagine they did.---------I am able to adjust date of swim, but it does not save. I forget to input day of swim occasionally so unfortunately my swim is posted day late. Hope the ability to do that is fixed. Also, many times I need to input info twice for it to save.---------It used to auto-import swim workouts from the health app, but for some reason they removed that feature. Now it’s back.---------Great website to use for logging and viewing my swim stats---------Apple Watch SE owner since October 2022. For some reason the app is overstating my distance in the water today I did 500 yards the watch record of 1200 yards however using the native activity app that comes with the phone My distance was recorded accurately. Any ideas?---------The leaderboard feature is absolutely incredible! Couldn’t have asked for a better tracking device!---------To use this app for *anything* you have to turn over incredible amounts of personal information.  If you make any part of your profile “private” the app won’t work with any of the myriad of virtual events. The UI is an abomination and doesn’t work effectively with manual entries, making this YET ANOTHER “service” that requires a $300 watch. Very unfortunate that USMS has partnered with such a low quality venture.---------Love building workouts and viewing them on my Apple Watch while swimming. Tracking accuracy is the best compared to other apps.---------When I complete a warm up the app will then say the workout is complete.  I have to continue the swim to continue to track the workout.  Overall, the app works well besides that glitch.---------I recently got back into the pool November 2020 and was very pleased that this app would log all of my swim workouts automatically but since Jan 3rd, 2021 it doesn’t recognize them. I’m not sure what to do to fix this problem. Please help!!!---------I was swimming with Garmin watches for a long time, and switch to Apple watch. I\\'m a technical person work the latest and greatest gadgets, and could not figure out how to connect your app to the watch (it did install it inn the watch). I have a five min rule, and off takes longer, you out (good thing took me less to figure out my Tesla).---------Not usable: will crash in the middle of a workout loosing all my work. Last time it crashed during my warm up 300 m. \\n\\nHad to go to the Watch app. Which does not have work outs and distance can be off but at least it does not crash. \\n\\nI want to be a happy customer again.---------Use only the done button helps---------Picked up swimming again and it really helps me track my progress!---------The old app prior to IOS 11 was great! HELP! The old app you gave lap number and accumulated time.....the new app is a step back ... please add these stats back to the app...say for a 1000 meter swim the old app displayed lap number and accumulated time. Thus I don’t know my accumulated times say for 200, 400 etc.....using the new app? Can you help? Thanks!---------Filters keep resetting and filtering favorite workouts out. Finding and creating workouts takes too long, and then you still have to jump through many hoops to find them. Hopefully they fix this soon.---------The core of the app works well. I swim about 10k a week, and the tracking works great with the apple watch.\\n\\nThe new update.... ehhhhh... what is the top section?! Filters dont seam to work correctly, harder to navigate... I hope track stays good!---------25 meter pool, the only workouts I could find were about 4 all freestyle. I was really hoping for kicking drills. The website doesn’t really function properly. Trying to find other swimmers at your pool, or just even setting your default pool Does Not Work. Lots of interesting ideas, next to no follow through on execution.---------I have use this app for a number of years. Early on I found it was fairly accurate, occasionally missing half a lap or so. I’m not sure what changed but right now the app is completely useless to me because it misses three or four laps at a time on a long segment. I’ve moved on to other apps that work better---------I find this app hard to figure out. Hard to turn off on my Apple Watch. \\nNeed some instructions as to what steps to do on the phone and watch to have it work the way it’s designed to. Not happy with it !---------This app has been unstable for years. Every time they make a change they break something else. \\n\\nThe latest is that you can no longer count laps. Pretty basic thing to request. The developers obviously have no quality control. \\n\\nThe app is also not private. And they share my location and name with others. I have no desire to have my name on a feed when my privacy is important to me. \\n\\nAt the very least fix the app so it can count laps again instead of yards---------The moment you swim the info on the watch is blurred out and only the time is shown. This is the main thing that makes the app useless and keeps it from being awesome. I don’t understand why the developer hasn’t fixed this yet---------Joining challenges keeps me going back to swim. Updates are slow but great for tracking swims.---------For some unknown reasons, the app stop recording the activity about 10 min earlier than the actual recorded time. I could find a solution to this annoying issue. Writing to support did not yet produce any result---------This app recently started crashing on my iPhone. I get about 30 seconds to view my workout and then it goes off. I deleted and reinstalled but that didn’t work. My Apple Watch and phone are both updated to the newest version.---------This would be the best swim tracker app if it didn’t have so many bugs, predominant amongst them the fact that it occasionally does not save a swim workout to the Apple Workout/Health app.---------Despite setting all my filters to the most relaxed options available I cannot find a single workout, even under the “All” screen. This seems like a pretty serious problem for an app with swim training as its raison d’être.---------Manual entry of a swim does not sync with Apple Health.  I have no issues with other health apps linking with Apple Health.---------The app syncs from my watch to the app about 60% of the time. \\nThis flaw is making it so I have to workout almost twice as much ...---------Please make similar to Garmin in being able to do totals for month and year. Instead of us having to manually add up. Also would like cumulate to date.---------I used this feature for every one of my swims and now I have to manually import. Can no longer get my splits.---------I just downloaded it and I like the iPhone app but every time I try to select it on my Apple Watch it just crashes back to the app screen.---------It has been a while with the covid shut down, but the app remains clunky and it’s flexibility to provide options are limited.---------Great.---------I just got a iPhone XS and Apple Watch 4. The 600 yards of freestyle I did synchronized to the Apple activity app under exercises, but the 200 yards of drills I did not sync. Is this a know issue?---------Love this app. It helps motivate me and keep me on track.---------However after updating to apple watch 8 it’s not importing my swims t the Apple activity tracker …..---------Great app in theory, but many of my swims are not recorded, not transferring from USMS FLOG it my iWatch. No response from the company other than “watch and wait.” Needs to get more responsive and user friendly for me to up my rating.---------Loved it till the latest update.  Now it just crashes when I select pebble.  Please fix pebble integration.---------This app has really helped me get motivated to get back in the pool!---------Downloaded app and clicked on workouts and app just said “loading” forever. Then couldn’t get off app without deleting it. Tried again and it did the same thing---------The app randomly splits pools while swimming, so the total number of pool in a swim is larger and thus the pace is faster than the actual one. I use the app with iWatch 7---------Many rhanks for the great app and all the functionalities around it! Fantastic job particularly under our COVID 19 circunstances4 congratulations!---------Pebble watch no longer supported so I can no longer use this app.---------Hate the new layout.  I liked the dashboard showing your average pace and last distance swum.---------Clunky interface for starting a swim from Apple Watch. Lap counting was terribly inaccurate, for example I swam 1600y breaststroke and the app only counted 950y. The swim tracking built in to the Apple workout app has been far more accurate.---------Just got the app, found and joined my masters team. But, the workouts won’t load from the workouts page on the app.---------The app randomly stooped letting me log in or create a new account even after I deleted and redownload it. Super annoying.---------I love using this app in the pool. I wish they would add an open water swim tracker.---------This app is very confusing to work. I couldn’t understand how to do it.---------If you want to use this with other than an Apple watch, don\\'t.  Stick with Strava.---------Don’t waste your time with this App. Constant bugs render this App totally useless. It drains your phone battery and overheats the phone. There is something seriously wrong with this App. Look elsewhere.---------Wish you had capabilities to sync with a FitBit Ionic. Was looking forward to using this app but my watch is not compatible.---------New version.  Locked out. \\n\\nForgot password doesn’t work.  Tried for 2 days.---------But it’s iffy at best \\n\\nNow it hasn’t recorded a swim since Dec 7\\nI have uninstalled and reinstalled. \\n\\nWent through an involved trouble-shooting a year or more ago, and it’s still hit or miss.\\n\\nWish I could depend on it.---------My last name is Cumming and the dirty minded app developers have made Cumming a prohibited last name. So, I can’t participate in USMS postal swims because some prude of an app developer doesn’t approve of my last name?---------Sometimes the app does not load my swim. It is not very reliable, which is too bad.---------I love the app,it has saved me from my home app.---------Doesn’t allow to set custom pool for those of us with exercise pools, I.e., Endless, Michael Phelps and Swimex pools - not all of us have to make turns!---------Loved this app- tracked my swims so well- then they updated to the latest version and now none of my swims sync from my Apple Watch to the app. Horrible.---------I have used this app and my Pebble watch for 3+ years, but today the app mysteriously discontinued providing a way to sync the app with my watch.  Bummer!  I have contacted support with no response.---------Won’t track different strikes, doesn’t measure correctly, and less than stellar interface---------Pretty good app. Syncing with my Garmin device finally after multiple attempts. I like the easy to read format and the ability to add a pool as well as a few other features though if I had my wishes I would request:\\n- my records section. I want to see my best times for different distances. It is cool to show a badge for fastest 400 yard but what is that time record? I think you can see this on the site but I could not find in app. \\n- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)\\n- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths \\n- more workouts to do. Options seem pretty limited to shorter distances. Master swim classes will do a 1650 for warm up. \\n- drill videos would be cool. I know they are available through you tube but it would be cool if they were here and built into the workouts.---------Only works with Apple or Samsung watches. Doesn’t work with Garmin.---------it’s work well even if the pool size is not standard lap.---------Does not show up on my watch.---------The app is so full of bugs it wouldn’t even download to use once. What a waste.---------Be nice if it could be turned off or stopped when I’m done swimming---------Only tracked 475 out of 800 meters interval. And the swim wasn’t saved as a workout, so it doesn’t show uo in the Activity app.---------I would love to use this with my Garmin watch and sync with training peaks.---------The app doesn’t do anything.---------Set up on Apple Watch. Swam 1700 yards in 25 yard pool and app recorded 350 yards swum.---------THIS APP IS SO GOOD AND LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE \\n\\nDOWNLOAD NOW!!!---------blah---------I have Apple’s new Series 2 watch. \\n\\nThe positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).\\n\\nThe negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate. (not really necessary but since the data is there it\\'d be good to incorporate). Hopefully the app will be improved, I like the concept.---------At first I was disappointed that the app didn\\'t count my breaststroke or kick sets, but the more I use it, I see that it\\'s algorithm is learning my strokes and adapting its analysis. All my breaststroke is now counted accurately and is starting to sometimes give me credit for kick sets. \\n\\nEven if it never quite gets the kicks counted, the ability to sense the difference between swimming and resting and the stats (some of which you can access immediately) put this app head and shoulders above the others I\\'ve tried on the Apple Watch.---------Still a little buggy. I uninstalled, then reinstalled after the app crashed when I still had 20 laps to complete. It may have been the Apple Watch because the Apple logo appeared and I couldn\\'t bring up any apps. I thought maybe the watch was downloading an IOS update or something. Whatever. It\\'s just very frustrating. I lost all of today\\'s data. Maybe my resistance gloves got in the way and pressed the stem. Other than that, I like this app. Some issues with lap count and stroke recognition though. Not a big deal for a casual swimmer like me.---------This app seems to have promise, but for this swimmer of quite modest abilities, it is not yet ready to replace my Garmin swim watch.\\n\\n1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.\\n\\n2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn\\'t record several hundred yards of my workout.\\n\\n3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin. These should be basic features of any swim  watch software.\\n\\nI will watch for software updates before trying again.---------I have just started using this new app for my swim routines and I can say that this is one of the better swim apps out there so far. I love being able to track my workouts and comparing lap times with my friends and other people who are using this app with ease. Not only that, just from using the app today, I found a few new local pools in my area that I didn\\'t know even existed before! Now that the new Apple Watch is waterproof, this is my go-to swim app to use with it.---------I\\'ve been using this app with my Apple Watch Series 2 for about three weeks. I have not tried to get super accurate information from it, but it does a very nice job of tracking my yardage and giving me a sense of how I was performing. \\n\\nThe quick drill setup on the watch is an excellent way to capture those kicking yards that don\\'t get logged by the watch. \\n\\nOverall, I am very pleased with the app, and it seems like they keep tweaking it and making it better each time.---------Bought a new waterproof Apple Watch last week, been shopping for best swim app. My master swim mates recommended this app to me. Absolutely love it!!  Love the fact that this app not only can track my daily swim workout, but also allow me to connect with other swimmers.  The best feature is that I can locate the pool close by using this app. This is huge for me since I need to travel a lot because of work, this make my life much easier as I want to keep swimming every day.---------The app is slow and clunky with an unintuitive interface. Instead of focusing on giving us quick and easy access to our swimming metrics, this app seems to instead focus more on social stuff and finding swimming pools (which it isn\\'t very good at) and it has the word \"unknown\" misspelled as well. Building a custom workout is actually way harder and slower than it should be, plus you constantly have to wait for the app to contact the servers because no one on the development team thought people might want to store their data locally on their phone. \\n\\nIt\\'s not terrible but it certainly isn\\'t good.---------The watch app is great. It\\'s much more fully featured than apple\\'s swim tracking app. \\n\\nHowever, the iOS software is pretty bad. The swimming stats are poorly organized, and the totals are usually incorrect. For example, any workouts from the current day don\\'t apply to the weekly total.  Also, the charts are wrong (showing workouts which didn\\'t occur). \\n\\nPlease update the iOS app and fix the bugs!---------Have been using this app with an Appe Watch 2.0 for a few months and have seen steady improvements in what it can do. Appreciate being able to record the skills distances within a workout now. Did have some issues with breast stroke detection, but that seems to be better after current update. Would like to see calories and sharing out from mobile app like you can in web site. Great app!---------I had a Garmin swim before and hated constantly pressing the button to start and stop intervals. That this app automatically distinguishes between intervals and resting at the wall is the single best feature for me. This is also a big improvement over the previous version which required scrolling to see everything and crashed a lot.---------Drill feature is great, so I use this over the built in app. However anything I do fast over a 50 is counted wrong. Did last 4 times I\\'ve done a 100 fast I\\'ll go in the 55-56 range it gives me a time of 1 minutes and says I only did a 75.  Same thing for the 200, only days I\\'ve done a 175.  Times are also off. It thinks I\\'m resting almost 5 seconds after I have actually finished.  Overall not terrible, drill mode is the only thing that keeps me using it since I can add back in those laps it missed.---------Apple\\'s built-in activity app is very accurate for tracking distance and deducing stroke type, but it requires manually stopping its chronometer to check time on individual sets, save or discard the record and launch a new activity before a new set. Very tedious! \\n\\nThis app has been very good at stopping the clock when I come to a rest and smart enough to reset the clock to zero before I start swimming again. Big thumps up! Unfortunately, its distance and stroke count is horribly inaccurate. At the moment, I can only use it as a smart chronometer.\\n\\nIt also nags about gaining access to health data numerous times a day. Very annoying. Ask once and stop bothering me for at least a week. \\n\\nHoping for the bugs to be fixed or a better alternative app to be launched.---------The Apple Watch app is very reliable for auto-detecting sets (no need to push buttons:-) and strokes. It also has a very easy way to include drill/kicking sets. \\n\\nOverall, it\\'s a great app for swimmers!\\n\\nSuggestion: While HR data from the watch is not always accurate, it would still be useful to have that displayed with the rest of the workout stats.---------I really enjoy using this app with my new Apple Watch and the additional details such as split times, swimmers in my area, clubs, etc not available with Apple\\'a app. The UI needs a little more user flexibility as I had to contact technical support to change my location. Highly recommended, otherwise.---------This is a great app for swimming. I like that it captures my drill sets and also returns what I \"just\" swam. I gave it a four star because it\\'s buggy and not working on my Apple Watch. I\\'m sure it\\'ll get fixed quite soon. Give it a try. I won\\'t be so quick to update, I\\'ll wait on every other one. :)---------I\\'m happy with the app and website overall, but a few weeks ago the yards I enter in Drill Mode on my Apple Watch don\\'t transfer to the app or website even though they show up on my watch.  It is basically a waste of time to use the drill mode since none of the yards show up.  I contacted customer service about this a few weeks ago and never heard any response.---------I use the app frequently and all works well and great!... until... i would say about 1 out 10 swims the screen gets activated and mess up the swim tracking. My last one it wiped out the whole work out. \\n\\nSo i guess you can turn on the water protection, but then you can glance during swim on progress/time/heartrate... \\n\\nOtherwise great app---------I didn\\'t want to spend more money on the new AppleWatch to be able to swim. I bought a waterproof cover for my current Apple Watch and this app has helped me track my swimming. I\\'m also glad they added a drill component. This has been very helpful. You will enjoy this app.---------I find this app kind of spotty. For instance, it doesn\\'t seem to capture different strokes mid workout. If I\\'m doing freestyle and switch to breaststroke it skips a lap or two before it picks it up. It also doesn\\'t capture all my workouts although that could be a function of a recent update, that wiped out a couple workouts. In any case, I don\\'t find it that much better than what Apple Watch gives you.---------I just returned to lap swimming and tried the app. It was accurate for distance, strokes and time. I wish it showed calories burned. Are you able to run the swim app and the Apple Watch workout app at the same time? The Apple Watch workout app doesn\\'t display different strokes, but does measure calories.---------I bought a watch specifically for the swim app and workout tracking and with every upgrade it seems to get worse. Now none of my workouts at all are displayed. Needs serious QE testing. Signed disappointed swimmer!---------When this app is working it\\'s Awesome! It\\'s accurate, it\\'s user friendly, it does everything I was looking for in a swim app. I loved it!!\\nThat\\'s the Good. The Bad.\\nLately its crashing. I\\'ve lost two swims.. one was almost complete for 3800 yards.. the other crashed twice during my swim.\\nThe Ugly. Your customer support is \\nHorrible!! It\\'s been over a week and I\\'ve not heard a word. Are you addressing this problem? Do you even care? I\\'d give this app 5+ stars. \\nIt\\'s that good.. but your customer follow through is awful! Please fix!---------I have never felt so disappointed about an app as this one. It glitches out and doesn\\'t record anything every third to every other time I swim. I originally got this app for the stroke count and because it could differentiate between each set. I don\\'t know what the purpose of using it is if it glitches out so often. Rest assured it will be deleted. FYI, this week out of the 5 times I swam, it recorded 3. DISAPPOINTING---------Pebble Time works great to track your distance during the workout. But syncing the Pebble to the app is Russian roulette. Every few work outs it will not only NOT sync the work out but will delete the workout too! Really frustrating when you are trying to track progress and use goals to motivate.\\n\\nReally disappointed that they couldn\\'t get this fundamental part of the whole app sorted out by now!---------After using this app for about a month, ~ 3 times a week, all performance measures noticeably improved. This has also reflected in swim style improvements that my co swimmers noticed. \\n\\nHighly recommend to all skill level swimmers.---------Got my workout exactly right even the first time. Apple\\'s workout app never did no matter what I tried. Allows to edit workout if needed (I could remove my experimental drill). Amazed!---------Since getting the new waterproof Apple Watch, I have been searching for a great swim tracking app.  This looked like it might be the one - until I discovered that there is. I way to tell the app about pools that it does not already recognize.  I swim in my own pool, and that means I am out of luck.  Seems like a very silly omission.---------I love the app, but consistently run in to issues with the app closing part way through my swim. This make it difficult to accurately track my workouts. \\n\\nI am running this on a 1st generation AppleWatch with a Catalyst, waterproof watch case. \\n\\nHope they can create a more stable app.---------Drill mode and send off timer took a bit of time to get use to but this has become my go to app for my swim workouts.  Best app I have found for Apple Watch for tracking Swim workouts.---------I have been using MySwimPro since mid Janurary 2017. I am 64 years old and use it daily from my Apple Series 2 watch. It does all I need it to do and I am sure more. I just needed it to count my laps but I can see other great information like elapse time, calories and pulse. I love this app.\\n\\nI have not tried all the other great parts of the app. \\n\\nThe support is excellent. I had a few questions and Adam Oxner replied that day. There was an app fix the next day. \\n\\nThanks MySwimPro team.---------Great new app. As someone who loves swimming I appreciate having this new app a lot. The app is great but definitely needs some improvements.\\nSince this is a new app I am giving it 5 stars and will be waiting for new releases.---------Apple watch app froze the second time I used it, requiring me to uninstall and reinstall (which deleted my swim.) When I tried to add the work out manually, it required the facility (why?) but didn\\'t have the facility in its database. All that said, it is a free app so you get what you pay for.---------Counting laps was a pain and I would always loose my count in reaching my goal each day. Now with this app I don\\'t have to worry about it as it know exactly where I am and how much I have done.---------I use this app all the time and really like it. The stats, number of laps, heart beat rate, everything gets counted. I only wish #of strokes would get back, disappeared after the update.---------This app works great! I have had no issues uploading all of my workouts from my Garmin swim watch. I also like being able to connect with the other swimmers in my club.---------As a triathlete, this app allows me to track every single workout and is providing me with the details I need to check on my improvements. Highly recommended---------This app works great for my Apple Watch 2 for capturing all my swimming data, including drills when I\\'m not moving my arms. I like the detailed data breakdown, workout analysis, and accurate lap count.---------The interface and ability to record kick sets held a lot of promise. But, alas, during my first workout the app recorded 175 yards for my 400 yard warmup. It was flummoxed by my 100 IM, recording only 25 yards... I switched mid workout to the native activity/swim app and it accurately counted the rest of my workout. \\nI\\'ll be deleting this app. Maybe they will improve in the future. \\nAlso I am concerned that it does not water lock the watch.---------Great app, very well-rounded. One of the best feature is the pool finder and seeing other people tracking their progress. Tried some other apps and like this one the best.---------I\\'ve only used this app a couple of times, but so far I love everything it does. Very easy set up and use during my workouts. Check it out!---------Used it for the first time today. Great job logging the workout, easy to share and connect with others.---------App works great with Apple 2 watch. My favorite parts...ability to easily select different pool sizes, the fact that it knows when I\\'m taking a breather. Great app!---------Love that I can use my pebble time to track my swims, but syncing is a crapshoot. Probably 30% of the time sync fails and workout data is lost.  Workout info on phone is minimal - would be nice to have workout breakdowns like on the website. HealthKit integration would be nice too.---------An app for the Apple Watch that is 1. Accurate 2. Allows you to select the option to do drills as you are swimming 3. Is free 4. Is awesome. \\nI absolutely  recommend this app!! Very satisfied!!---------This app is great for keeping track of your workout and even motivates through friendly competition at your local pool. Works great with the new Apple Watch!!---------This is the best swim app so far. I can connect with other clubs and swimmer. Its nice to locate pools around you within the app. Finally, i can track my Swims. Cant wait to go swimming again ❤️---------Load up your pool of choice or find one. The apps knows the size of pool.  Starts when you start.  Counts the strokes.  Splits. All totals up.  Great for all levels of swimmers.---------So close to perfect. I could have rated it 5 but there is room for improvement in charts, export options, data sharing with other apps, etc.---------Love not having to count my laps. Or forget to record them! I have been more motivated to swim since using the app.---------Tried in a few swims. First swim seemed to routinely miss the last 25 off each interval. Couldn\\'t accurately detect stoke type.\\n\\nNext swim I start tracking, swim 400m and look at watch to see 75m. Using Apple Watch 2.\\n\\nInterface is very slow and non native, forced to setup an account with a login system that disallows certain characters for email but allows you to create the account, just not login ever again. Password must be short and bad.\\n\\nI would forgive those bits of tracking actually worked.---------Easy to navigate, with good tracking for my personal progress. Looking forward to using the leaderboard for motivation. Hassle free device pairing.---------This app seems to be early beta status.\\n\\n1. Like other users, uploading is spotty at best.\\n\\n2.  App is pretty limited on what you can log about workout.  Easier for me just to go to website on a pc.\\n\\n3.  I use Pebble time, and accuracy on lap counting is pretty horrible.  I swim 1-2 miles per workout and it does not track well.  Drills and sprints seem to track better,  maybe because motion is more vigorous than my distance swims. \\n\\nIll give it another month and update if they have managed to make something of this.---------Good way to track swimming activity. Knows when you\\'re resting, which the Workout app isn\\'t able to do.---------I found Lapse are not counted accurately recorded. I tried using distance and lap count. Distance is more accurate. The Lap count recorded each length of 25 yards/meters as 1/2 lap. It also missed more laps than distance.---------Tracked my distance, laps and rest time very accurately. Plus transferred the data to the phone from my watch correctly!  Happy!---------Whether you\\'re a recreational swimmer or a competitive one, this app does it all! Definitely a great addition to my training!---------Unfortunately when you are done and try to upload the workout the app does not synchronize the data from Pebble. It\\'s worth noting the watch app works amazing accurately but it is a shame the data cannot be uploaded to track your swimming activities---------Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn\\'t. The past three times it wouldn\\'t sync, no matter WHAT I did. I followed instructions, but wouldn\\'t sync the new workouts. I would LOVE to be able to count on this app to work. Hopefully they will fix it soon.---------The app works well and is reasonably accurate on lap count. Fails miserably on breast stroke. I like the drill mode for kicking and use that to handle breast stroke failing. Wish the drill mode entry of length was better.---------The app is accurate on tracking, but cannot determine my location. I also cannot manually input my profile detail or even input the pool I visit. Seems if you do not live in the US  you can not make your swimming great again.---------The Apple Watch 2 is decent for casual swimmers.  If you really want some detailed analysis of your workout this app is a no-brainer.---------Having used the Apple Watch app and now the Swim app, there is no comparison. Fantastic, easy to use and accurate.---------Great app! Developers did a nice job at making this app flow beautifully on the apple watch.---------UI needs a little work, but it\\'s the most accurate tracker of distance out of all apps I\\'ve used. It\\'s made my new Apple Watch so much more useful for me.---------Enjoy using this tracker for my daily swims.  Like the data set shared between the app, my Apple Watch and the Health app on the iPhone.---------Love this app for my triathlon training when I\\'m in the pool. Stroke rate, Swolf, distance per 100. It has everything.---------Only supports tracking with one of a few, select devices. No manual entry option. It might be useful if you have one of the devices they support (except the pebble), but otherwise this app is useless. Deleted.---------I\\'m new to swimming and this app is great to track workouts. Wearables are a huge plus when paired with this app---------The app does a great job of tracking swims ( laps and distance) and the basic information. Uploads are fast when and if they happen. App seems to reset or shut off on occasion.---------Swam for 32 mins at home, but app adjusted for 13:48. Watch say 11:03 with resting time of almost 10 mins. I barely rested. 2 or 3 seconds between laps. While it beats the Apple Watch app, it\\'s still inaccurate.---------I use it with the Garmin Fenix 3 and found it accurate---------Nice app! I like the social aspect and can\\'t wait to get in the pool and start logging work outs.---------I really enjoy tracking my progress and mileage.---------Pretty accurate swim tracker.  Gets the job done.---------Love this app on my Apple Watch as it does not stop every time I lift my arm !!---------User friendly and very helpful! High five!---------I\\'ve tried this app twice, and both times it has reset after 500 meters. The 1st time it lost my workout completely. I emailed customer service, but never received a response sooooooo.... DELETE!!!!---------App works great with the new Apple Watch. Stoked---------This app does not track distance well, nor does the time stop when one pushes \"end work\", nor does it sync your workout with your phone. It just does not deliver.---------I wish there was a choice for swimming in a lake or an ocean. Currently I swim the same distance every time but it is recorded anywhere from 100 to 600 yards.---------Is a free app, detects the strokes (most of the times) detects the distance, and again... is free! Love it!---------Not thrilled with this watch.  Inconsistent so not dependable for keeping track of swims.  Sometimes turns off halfway through a swim session.  Want a feature that will edit/delete.---------Much better than swimpro---------As others have noted, the latest Pebble update seems to have broken the app. No workouts will sync and the data appears to just be lost.---------I love this app! It does so much in recording my swims---------I Haven\\'t upload none of my trainings! I did just manually on the site! Getting worst each upgrade!---------Horrible experience with the updated version of this app. It just doesn\\'t record distance or laps properly. Junk.---------This one tracks your distance, time and heart rate. The open water course is still a mess of spaghetti due to GPS  issues but still superior to the native Apple Watch program for open water. Pool swimmers will appreciate the workouts. It is FREE! If the GPS improves would rate 5 stars. All in all I really appreciate this app. Thanks to the swim.com team!---------Even for free, don\\'t waste your time downloading this. It\\'s Very inaccurate and *Might* record 40-50% of your distance or laps. Support is non existent.---------Hate apps that don\\'t work unless you give out your Facebook or email.  They love to send you junk.  No matter how good the app. Not worth it---------Can no longer upload workouts from pebble. Devs please fix!!!---------It is reliable and fun to use.---------Used to be a great app. Pebbles latest operating system upgrade renders this app completely useless. Won\\'t upload any of my workouts---------Since the fitness club I swim at is not in the database, could not even set-up the first workout. Deleted.---------Uploads don\\'t work, does not sync with pebble, no HealthKit integration, new version can\\'t even count laps on pebble. Garbage.---------I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context\\n\\nDistance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I\\'ve only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I\\'d say the two are about equal.\\n\\nTiming:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I\\'ve had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  \\n\\nIntervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I\\'m doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can\\'t recognize a single one - not if I\\'m manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I\\'m not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.\\n\\nLap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.\\n\\nPools size changes:  I\\'ve tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don\\'t think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.\\n\\nOveral, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.---------Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn\\'t appear on the watch. \\n\\nAlso, again, if you\\'re going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you\\'ve been. \\n\\nI was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. \\n\\nI submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn\\'t gotten a response, and was told I\\'d receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn\\'t work. I responded and was told that I\\'d get a response to that in... 48 hours. I\\'ve still heard nothing. \\n\\nIf you\\'re going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it\\'s just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can\\'t get this feature to work. \\n\\nAt this point between your faulty features and terrible customer service I\\'ll wait to deal with one of your competitors that gets custom pool sizes into their app.---------Good for me---------Great---------Tried using it with my Apple Watch but it couldn’t tell when I ended a lap and I had to manually advance to the next drill. Didn’t log as a workout either in the swim.com app or apple workouts. \\n\\nLove the idea of getting workouts on my watch but not helpful if I can’t track my progress. Easier to just print out a workout and stick it on a spare kickboard.---------I am not sure why my time on swim.com is faster than my time on my activity when I start there but the distance is the same. Great otherwise---------I’ve been using the swim.com app for more than a year and I like it a lot. There are however, a few points that could be improved:\\n- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. \\n- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. \\n- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. \\n- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. \\n\\nIn general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!---------I got this app to track open water swims. As stand-alone app, it’s quite good. Distance is much more accurate than with Apple Watch, and it even includes breast stroke distance, but calories only appear in iPhone fitness app after a lag, and don’t count towards daily move goal. Distance appears to be the inaccurate Apple Watch measure. Also, there’s no information about strokes swum. \\n\\nI’ll wait until these bugs are fixed before using swim.com to track my swims.---------The most annoying thing about the swim.com app is that if you don’t enter the challenges on the day that they start… all swims prior to when you enter the challenge do not count EVEN if they were swum during the challenge duration time. For example… challenge goes from sept 02-October02, you swim on the 2 and 3rd but don’t see the new challenge until the 4th.. TOO BAD those yards don’t count for the challenge. There should be a way for swim.com to remedy this. It makes swimmers discouraged to sign up for the challenges.---------I have used swim.com for many years and now it has been more of an irritant than anything else. Swim sets freeze up, drills are inaccurately reported from the watch to the phone and many lost swim sessions because the software just crashes on the watch. I have updated everything and your software continues to be very problematic. Unfortunately I’ve been using it for about 10 years and really enjoyed it until now. I have sent number of support emails to the appAnd they have not responded. Really disappointed and with swim.com---------While the app seems work accurately in the pool, I\\'ve had several problems. First, I signed up with an account with my Appl Strava manually. Files aren\\'t recognized. I fine ID through the app. However, the browser version has no option to sign in with Apple ID. I emailed support about that, but I\\'ve still received no response after a week. Also, after multiple attempts and consultations with their support blog, I can\\'t get it to export to Strava automatically. Then, when I tried to export FIT files manually, Strava wouldn\\'t recognize the files. I then opened a new account with my email address so I would be able to login through the browser. I then tried to import the workouts from my other account, but Swim.com didn\\'t even recognize its own FIT files created by their own app. It seems like this app isn\\'t being kept up to date, and their support department has gone AWOL.---------Since going mobile and making the website non-functional, Swim.com is less and less appealing. It has limited functionality and access to less information. Why not do both, the website is up but removed access to workouts. Easier to compare workouts on website.---------This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.\\n\\nA feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.\\n\\nThanks.---------Good. Never opened or used but I rlly love it BEST APP EVER !!---------I am getting into swimming and I love the Swim.com Leaderboards. I also tried other apps but the swim tracking was not as accurate as Swim.com’s proprietary tracking algorithms. Love it!!---------It is accurate with yardage and stroke recognition. I like the drill and pace function. My biggest issue is the poor data transfer back to the iPhone app. Sometimes it works and other times it will not transfer back to the phone. I have tried most swim tracker apps and like the swim.com watch interface.  This app is the only one that has insistent issues with data transfers. When this is fixed I’ll start using it again.---------I love this app because the swim.com leaderboard has inspired me to swim an incredible distance, over 4000 km in two years. I have moved up from 271 to number 2 on the worldwide total distance leaderboard. \\n\\nI love this app because I can look at workout statistics after each workout that is uploaded to swim.com. \\n\\nI hate this app because it randomly refuses to upload  my workouts from my Apple Watch to swim.com app on the phone. Surprisingly, it will upload those workouts to the apple activity app for total distance only. But then I get no credit for the leaderboard on Swim.com. By my I have lost up to 100 km of leaderboard distance credit this way. \\n\\nI hate this app because the feature of leaderboard filter over specific time periods eg distance last week, last month, last 2 months, etc. has never worked. \\n\\nI hate this app because I have contacted swim.com multiple times about these issues. While the written responses are very friendly, nothing is fixed. \\n\\nThere is so much promise to this app if it would just be tweaked to work better.---------This app worked great for me for about a month. I love the drill function as I do a fair amount of kicking and one armed fly drills. And the planned workout integration is nice for more advanced swimmers. My only suggestion would be to allow more data integration into the activity app so you can see sets there (like you can if you use the Apple Watch Workout app). But just a suggestion as the Swim.com app does allow this. \\n\\nThen the swim.col app stopped syncing with the health app. My privacy settings are set to allow the swim.com app to write and read the motion and fitness data. My sources are all setup in the health app. Nothing syncs. Started suddenly and for no apparent reason (no iOS or app updates happened between when it was working and now). I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling all sorts of apps. Restarting the phone and watch. Hard restarting the phone. Even restoring my iPhone. No dice. The biggest problem for me is that I no longer see a workout logged in activity app. I get the exercise credits because my heart rate was up, but no workout is logged. \\n\\nI have contacted the app developers several times. No response. I will have to stop using this app and start using the workout app. And manually logging kicking yards. I’d really much prefer to not do this, but oh well. Perhaps it’ll start working at some point. Tomorrow I am going to try running both apps and see what happens.---------I have used this app with my old Apple Watch Series 2 and tried again with the Series 4. It continues to overestimate my laps. The native Apple Watch swimming app and MySwimPro are and have been both spot-on when it comes to counting my laps and distance. Not sure what the issue is with the Swim.com app and it’s a shame. I really wanted to use this app for my pool swimming.---------I want to use this app. I love swim.com and use it to track workouts. I have to export and upload from the default Apple application. The app only properly detects crawl and will not count breaststroke and leaves big gaps in the workouts.---------***Update - 02-10-2017\\nMore updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. \\nThe first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. \\nSecondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven\\'t had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. \\nThird, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. \\nThe app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. \\nOne problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.\\nBut all in all, it seems to be improving. \\n\\n***Update - 12-19-2016\\nAfter a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn\\'t improved either.\\n\\nWhile this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. \\n\\n***Original review:\\nWhen I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.\\n\\nSo what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.\\n\\nOnce you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. \\n\\nSo even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. \\n\\nWhy then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn\\'t very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It\\'s off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don\\'t know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.\\n\\nOther problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.\\n\\nSo for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.---------App.has gone from functional to brick. Says it cannot connect to server.---------It\\'s January now and I haven\\'t been able to sync between my Pebble and this app since August, and I\\'ve tried all kinds of gyrations to try and get them to sync. Now it is much WORSE. I just updated the Pebble part of the Swim duo and it has completely taken over my watch. I kill the swim app and it comes back before I can get to any other menu item, so I can\\'t even reboot the watch. And this version still asks to be made my Activity app every.single.time.it.runs no matter that I keep saying no. If it was a person, we would call that a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The ONLY reason I keep using is because the stopwatch digits are big and easy to read while I\\'m in the pool and not wearing my glasses.'"

       "['I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.\\nP. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!',\n",
       " 'My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. \\n\\nI have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. \\n\\nAnother benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.',\n",
       " 'This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don’t know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!',\n",
       " 'The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don’t have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There’s no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don’t take the proper steps of progression then I don’t get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.',\n",
       " 'This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. \\n\\nMy feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. \\n\\nThanks for a game changing product!',\n",

I am a terrible form, overweight guy trying to lose 100 pounds and this app and googles have already made a big difference and I’m swimming longer. So thankful for this product. It is for everyone!',\n",

I’ve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light. I understand that the goggles are new and still working through updates and I really appreciate what this company has done for swimming!',\n",

How to stop and click a clicker or write something down.  No more. I just swim. I just got the polar optical sensor I haven’t quite figured out how to connect it but when I do I may write more',\n",

I really look forward to learning more about my swims afterwards as well as seeing the real time info available as I swim!!!',\n",

Form should take a look at how Zwift (for cycling) does it because it cannot be that hard!\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nResponse from Form: “Unfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.”\\n\\nMy Response:\\nFirst, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I’m sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin’s limitation? \\n\\nBTW, I’ve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.\",\n",

What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace',\n",

Almost every other sport tracking wearable gives you the ability to integrate workouts with no extra cost. I will stick to manually performing workouts with the unsubscribed version until they break, then likely seek a different brand.',\n",
       " 'If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form. Would be cool to see an estimated distance so I don’t have to do the math myself.',\n",

       " \"I have these googles and they are pretty neat.  I’m fortunate to be grandfathered in and the workouts features are nice.  I’m very disappointed that Form decided to move to a subscription model for any future users.  You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.\\n\\nThe subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.\\n\\nSee below the email I received from FORM.\\n\\nIf you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26. Real-time metrics in pool, open water, and swim spa are now part of the FORM membership. New swimmers will be required to have an active membership to access this and all member features.\",\n",

       " 'Compared to regular swim googles these googles reduce your vision by about 50 percent. That’s a big trade off to have have data that is available, slightly delayed, from other sources like Apple Watch and and pool time clocks.  Open water swimming requires navigation and spotting landmarks.  This is extremely difficult with the tunnel vision and smoked tint of these google.  Feels like you are swimming in a cave.

I don’t own any other devices because I don’t compete much and I’m not a triathlete. However, to be able to see my elapsed time and stroke pace in the lake in real time is AWESOME! I look forward to future enhancements in the open water setting. \\n\\nI’ve also used them in a pool and they absolutely deliver! Where I swim there are no pace clocks, just a little Walmart wall clock. Again, since I don’t own other devices, I’ve gotten used to winging it a bit. These goggles have made a big difference! I love that my timer is always right in front of me (although I have to admit...apparently I’ve been slacking a bit without that accountability). I have it set for stroke pace and lap counter. I’ve been working on keeping a particular cadence depending on distance. The lap counter is extremely helpful for long sets (500-1500 stretches) because my mind wanders. Sometimes I lose count and I can hear my old coach’s mantra: “If unsure, do more.” So I’d do an extra 100 to make up for my daydreaming. No more extra distance with my Form goggles (take that, coach!). \\n\\nFinally, I love the feedback on my efficiency (or not...I have WORK to do). It’s one thing to have a good turnover but if you’re just windmilling down the lane it’s no good. This has given me great insight into where I need work. \\n\\nI would recommend these goggles to anyone as another valuable tool in their training toolbox. I’m very pleased with them so far. Now if they can just figure out how to stream HBO for those long swims....🤣',\n",
       " 'Great goggles, but major sync issues to Apple Health every time FORM does a software update. I think issue  is that FORM needs to be like all other exercise apps first requesting permission from customer to write or read data.  Apple privacy policy requires customer must give permission to the app to write or read data. Then FORM would be listed under Settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness, and be able to write data.\\n\\nAll of my other exercise apps are listed under settings, Privacy, Motion and Fitness. Why not FORM? I never get an answer to this question from the tech team. The tech team seems to ignore customer suggestions and focuses more on upselling their new paid swim programs.\\n\\nFORM’s only suggestion was  deleting  and reinstalling the app, restarting phone, but that does not solve problem  ….FORM still goes back to being listed as inactive under Active Health under Active Energy data sources.  So if you are interested in syncing FORM swim data, such as active energy calories burned to Apple Health, it does not work and the developer seems to have given up trying to fix it.\\n\\nBottom line FORM does not work to sync with Apple Health.  Since last update on 8/24/21 no data has transferred from FORM to Apple Health Active Energy. This happens everytime FORM  does an update.',\n",

       "\"I like sport gadgets, but usually 9 out of 10 times my enthusiasm ends in great disappointment. However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles I’ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.\\nP. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watch’s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too. It’s my only future feature request!---------My biggest question was if I was going to be able to read the data without my glasses and can tell you No problem as the data is easy to read and very clear in my vision. \\n\\nI have recently started running Triathlon events and was struggling with the swimming portion. I have been looking into Form goggles for a while and decided to purchase them as I do all my swimming in open water. My first impression is they were very easy to set up and connect to my Garmin 745 watch. After several swims I can already see they are helping me swim farther by knowing the distance I have covered as well as time length and pace of my swim. I set a goal of distance and/or time I want to swim and now I know when I have completed my goal. \\n\\nAnother benefit to me is the fact that in open water lake swimming I can’t see the bottom so it was like swimming in the dark whenever face was in the water and now I focus on the data which is very easy to read.---------This has been a game changer in how I swim. First, the app is great and is the required companion for the Form goggles. The goggles are amazing and after almost half a year of reliable swim tracking in the mornings and at night, I love these goggles and the app. They are fast, reliable, the screen is clear underwater and gets out of the way. Most importantly it lets me enjoy my swims without counting in my head and lets me have the data to know how I am performing and set timing goals to improve. I don’t know how it knows my stroke type, but again these goggles and the app are magic and I highly recommend them both!---------The googles are fine and the workout generation is fine. However, something as basic as pausing your workout plan or being able to go back and pick up in you plan where you left off is not possible. If, for whatever reason, I don’t have the ability to complete 3 swims a week for 8 weeks, I should be able to go back to the last swim I completed and start from there. The progression system is time locked like an AFK video game. There’s no reason that I should have to wait 7 days for a workout week to unlock and then not be able to go back and complete missed workouts. Part of this is building endurance or achieving a goal set in the plan and if I don’t take the proper steps of progression then I don’t get as much out of week 7 as I could if I left off on week 3 This seems like a HUGE miss on their part and completely neuters an entire aspect of what could make this set up great.---------This and bone conduction headphones have me swimming 2-3 times a week. The workout planner is awesome - it keeps it interesting. \\n\\nMy feature request to the developer - please allow setting a critical swim pace, and allowing the workout builder to set intensity based on that, so that in the pre set instructions it can give a time per lap to shoot for. Or even allowing custom notes where I could enter that. \\n\\nThanks for a game changing product!---------I love the product and app. Everything is done very well and I can’t imagine my life without the googles. Some reviews claim that this product should be for serious swimmers. I am a terrible form, overweight guy trying to lose 100 pounds and this app and googles have already made a big difference and I’m swimming longer. So thankful for this product. It is for everyone!---------I love these goggles so much, but when it comes to charging them the goggles won’t charge well. I’ll put them on the charger and the red light comes on. I’ve tried to fix this issue by rearranging the way the charger connects to the goggles, but the light stays red except for some spots that are green. The problem with this is that the goggles are never guaranteed to be charged when I leave them with a green light. I understand that the goggles are new and still working through updates and I really appreciate what this company has done for swimming!---------I don’t understand their pricing but right now I don’t care because I like this app and my goggles so much. It was always so annoying to me to have to remember my labs. How to stop and click a clicker or write something down.  No more. I just swim. I just got the polar optical sensor I haven’t quite figured out how to connect it but when I do I may write more---------After admiring them for awhile, I’m very grateful to have been gifted a pair of Form goggles by my teammate. I’m fascinated by all the metrics available upon synching and am very happy with the very user friendly interface!  I really look forward to learning more about my swims afterwards as well as seeing the real time info available as I swim!!!---------I was really disappointed to learn the collected data from the Form Goggles cannot be pushed to Garmin Connect. Form should take a look at how Zwift (for cycling) does it because it cannot be that hard!\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nResponse from Form: “Unfortunately this is due to a limitation from Garmin's side and we are not able to send them our data.”\\n\\nMy Response:\\nFirst, thank you for responding, it shows Form cares about customer satisfaction. However, Zwift (and I’m sure others) seems to send data to Garmin Connect just fine, how is this Garmin’s limitation? \\n\\nBTW, I’ve been a developer for 25 years so I can understand technical limitations between disparate systems but if other platforms are pushing data to Garmin, the problem is most likely NOT them.---------I love the idea behind this as it records your laps and swims and just the rest timer itself is awesome just to keep you on schedule with your workout.  What I really wish for is a current lap timer during your swim.  I have the settings to have it turned off mid lap then just flash split times after the turn.  But seeing the time of the current lap I feel would be a big motivator and helpful to keep you on pace---------Goggles/software do function well and as advertised. However, subscription price for workouts in addition to the high initial cost of buying their product is a slap in the face. Almost every other sport tracking wearable gives you the ability to integrate workouts with no extra cost. I will stick to manually performing workouts with the unsubscribed version until they break, then likely seek a different brand.---------If a user can estimate their DPS (distance per stroke) in the settings it would be possible to calculate distance swam in open water setting without GPS since Form already calculates stroke rate. Understanding that this is all estimated... it is a motivation tool for a swimmer.  Swimming with a watch is annoying and I will never do it. That is why I bought Form. Would be cool to see an estimated distance so I don’t have to do the math myself.---------I bought the goggles for the real-time telemetry.  The true potential was the workouts.  I stay engaged and improving without boredom.  I use a plentiful variety of structured workouts that use drills, equipment and just plain fun to pour on the power!  My times are improving too.---------I have these googles and they are pretty neat.  I’m fortunate to be grandfathered in and the workouts features are nice.  I’m very disappointed that Form decided to move to a subscription model for any future users.  You CAN NOT use these goggles without a subscription now.\\n\\nThe subscription is on par with the cost of a Peleton subscription and more than Zwift or Wahoo Systm, and provides way less value.\\n\\nSee below the email I received from FORM.\\n\\nIf you purchased your goggles before May 26, your FORM experience won't change. But we wanted to let you know what's changing for swimmers who purchase after May 26. Real-time metrics in pool, open water, and swim spa are now part of the FORM membership. New swimmers will be required to have an active membership to access this and all member features.---------These goggles are fantastic and the app is the perfect complement. It lets me dig into my swim data to track my performance improvement. The app is well laid out and intuitive and allows you to share workout data among friends.---------I have been using the goggles regularly for both pool and OW swims. Both with Apple Watch and Garmin connect as the goggles when used for OW simply function as a display while the Watch control the recording and swim.\\n\\n1. Current pace not available, only average page for entire workout\\n2. HR displayed after pausing workout is wrong, both in FORM app and goggles. Heart rate shown is 20 BPM above actual rate and when examine using the FORM app the entire second half of the swim has HR increased by 20 BPM compared to first half.\\n\\nIn short totally unreliable data.\\n\\nFurthermore this kind of errors are obvious software bugs and reveals that the goggles have not been tested properly when used for OW swims.\\n\\nThe only thing the goggles can be used for during OW swim is to display the total distance.---------Compared to regular swim googles these googles reduce your vision by about 50 percent. That’s a big trade off to have have data that is available, slightly delayed, from other sources like Apple Watch and and pool time clocks.  Open water swimming requires navigation and spotting landmarks.  This is extremely difficult with the tunnel vision and smoked tint of these google.  Feels like you are swimming in a cave.  Fit is average as the googles can be worn with either side up which is sub-optimal for a good fit.---------The googles are great! The app is also clean and easy to use. However, as a competitive swimmer many of the workouts are very simple. I would like the ability to create my own workouts so then I have complete control on the workouts and then could align with my workout schedule.---------Form is the best in swimming metrics. The display quality and comfort of the googles are uniquely awesome, as well as the app! The only missing feature to be able set a certain distance to reach for the ability to count down and show the remaining distance. This is a base for a long distance swimmer.---------These puppies are amazing! The AR display helps me track my laps and splits and times and distance and calories. WHILE I swim! It’s amazing and I love them. Plus, their customer service is excellent. 10/10 thank you FORM! Legiiiiiit.---------I use a Garmin watch and Garmin connect to track my swims. Form will retrieve my data from the watch but if I just use the goggle data it won’t interface with Garmin connect. Also I accidentally deleted a swim and there is no way to re-retrieve the data or copy yesterday’s swim. It’s a new app so I get it. The goggles are awesome, clear and informative.---------The app is good: responsive and user friendly.  It’s great to see all the stats in one place as well as all of my workouts. Video tutorials of the drills are also very helpful---------I was a bit skeptical about these goggles and did not believe the hype, then I tried them. Wow, what a remarkable change to my training and focus. I love them.---------I am enjoying the glasses and app.  Joining is too expensive considering I had to buy the goggles and already pay for pool time. Will hold on that for now---------Please let me have more stats on real time like I can choose for turn and rest.\\n\\nThanks!---------Cannot wait to monitor my heartbeat live. Thank you Form Team.---------There is no app support. Multiple attempts at contact have gone unanswered for weeks. No ability to create your own workout and download to goggles. Have to join a subscription service for workouts. There are some included with the app but seem ti be geared to the novice swimmer.---------Form goggles are awesome.  Takes your swimming to a whole other level! And their customer service is top notch.---------Love the new graphs in the app, and excited to try out some of the new dashboard options---------This app is an unexpectedly amazing bonus to using the FORM Swim Goggles.  It feels like Strava for swimmers.  Nice work to all the developers who put this together.  👌---------So cool to get a quick in depth review of a swim. Broken down by stoke, stroke count, and interval!!!\\nNot to mention the exact rest interval, without ever looking at the clock!!!!---------Going to have to share this with our other alumni swimmers. Great product! App is cool too.---------Never could keep track of laps and stats. These goggles help me know where I am at and keeps me motivated.---------Paired easily with my goggles.  Syncs fairly quickly.  The data is rich and useful.  Helps round a pretty damned strong training experience with the form goggles---------These goggles are great motivation to get to the pool and get fit.  Great value. Great support.   Changed swimming for this 67 year old.---------In a pair with Sony Waterproof headphones the googles motivates me to do more swim laps. \\nHeadphones keeps me entertained, and the googles tells me where I am at.---------Great tool for anyone who is interested in quantifying their performance and efficiency.  Goggles are comfortable to wear and easy to use---------Need to be able to export data excel or a graphing widget to analyze long term trends---------These are great goggles!  I use them for pool swims and endless pool.  The pulse accessory works well.  I wish they’d partner with endless pool.---------Heads up display while swimming revolutionizes and revitalized swim practice.---------How many times do I have to say 'no thanks to join your free trial? It's however many times a week I Swim! Stop harassing me---------Make make your Coaches redundant.---------The software is decent. The actual goggles have poor field of vision for sighting in open water---------for some reason the app doesnt work for me.---------The fit is superb. The lap count and total distance cover are inaccurate. I noticed that the unit misses flip turns occasionally.---------I love the Goggles, but then they forced me to write a review losing good will.---------App is not intuitive and difficult to navigate on phone. Googles are horribly inconsistent in tracking laps.  Very disappointed.---------The goggles are the best thing in the pool I just wish it would connect to the apple health app---------My one complaint is the main stats can’t include Average Pace / 100 yards!---------Every penny!---------The best gift ever!!!!---------Love my new goggles.---------Love this technology!---------Pog u---------New software update broke the goggles---------As described in title---------It recognizes freestyle but all my breast strokes are considered resting 😢 - I’m in a swim spa.---------I was excited when I first saw the Form goggles. However since seven months out of the year I do my training in open water I didn’t purchase them. I knew it would only be a matter of time before the open water functionality would be introduced. \\n\\nMy husband recently gave me a pair for my birthday, and I love them!

       "'Amazing app, amazing coach and superb courses. I am enjoying the app so much and it motivates me to go at least twice a week for swim. I find courses are very well made and help any aspiring swimmer at all levels. \\nI used to swim but the coach had changed my swim style and technique so much and it improved my swimming endurance and skill to a great extent. \\nThank you for the wonderful service. The subscription is very well worth. In fact I would say you get lot more than you pay if you are persistent with the workouts and the courses---------Tried a few training apps for getting into swimming and this one is the best I’ve seen. Tips are helpful and easy to understand---------I have been trying to learn how to freestyle without a coach. After 50+ videos saying keep your elbows up, this is the 1st videos to actually SHOW you how to do it. Also the demonstrations OUT OF WATER are very helpful. I love the way this app and it’s videos are so helpful. I began my swimming with 27-28 strokes to get me across the pool. In 5 days with the help of this training, today I crossed the pool in 17-18 strokes. I’m impressed!---------Great app! Simple as it is, works good for beginners and pros as well! Just download this app, find a pool and get that practice done!---------They put me on 2 levels before champion but the workouts are way too easy. I also told the survey, I swim for 2 hrs and a minimum of 5000 yards. The training they give me is less than 2 hrs and WAY less than 5000 yards.---------Thank you guys. Appreciate your work.---------I love Swimup’s YouTube channel so I was really excited about their app. It’s a nice minimalistic app that’s simple and not complicated. But my biggest problem are the videos. Why isn’t there any sound in the videos for technique, drills, etc. I love Swimup’s YouTube videos because of the explanations. It’s very frustrating when I want to watch a video for technique and drills and there is no commentary. Due to that, the app unfortunately doesn’t live up to what the channel has proudly made themselves to be :/---------No voice tutorials makes these videos useless.'"
