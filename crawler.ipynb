Three areas Iâ€™d like to see improvements. One, the ability to see on my watch what is coming up next. I donâ€™t see the next set until the final 10 seconds begin to count down and, if I need to put on or take off fins for example, I fall behind. Second, if I do fall behind it would be great to be able to pause or restart the set. As it is, I just usually skip one interval to get back on track. And lastly, sending the workouts to my watch (Apple SE) is glitchy at times and I need to reset the watch and/or my phone (has happened twice in the first 4x using it). But overall great and something I expect to use ongoing.', 'rating': 5, 'isEdited': False, 'title': 'Great - a few areas could be improved', 'userName': 'Swimming in NJ'}\n",

The customized coaching is great and the app certainly pushes you but never has unreasonably high expectations of you. The ability to customize what goals you are working towards, how often you swim, how fast you swim, and what strokes you swim are all excellent features. Only negative Iâ€™ve experienced is minor bugs with sync issues between the app and my smartwatch. This hasnâ€™t impacted my ability to use all the features just needed to use work arounds with how the workout is accessed by the watch. Minor bugs stop me from giving it a 5* but I am still loving the app. If I could see some additional features the biggest would be the ability to go back a set/split in a workout. Sometimes I canâ€™t keep up with the times it says and I fall behind so this would help keep me on track. Also, the ability to toggle which swim equipment you have access to. My pool offers kick boards and pullbouys but no fins or paddles and Iâ€™d imagine it varies for everyone.', 'rating': 4, 'isEdited': False, 'userName': 'Rcote33', 'title': 'My Swim Pro Review'}\n",

Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.\\n\\nThe app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. \\n\\nI wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  Iâ€™m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.

However, the Form swim goggles have by far exceeded my expectations - they simply work. All the features advertised work better than expected and the app is a solid companion of the goggles. If you want to focus on your swim and forget counting laps or looking up for your time, the Form swim goggles are the best solution. They are also for me personally one of the best fitting goggles Iâ€™ve ever used, but that might be different for others people. I am really grateful for the team having developed these goggles. I wish more people knew about them. They are now also sold in Europe, but I was able to order them from the US.\\nP. S. : last week I tried out the new open water feature after a firmware update. I connected my Form goggle with my Apple Watch series 4 and went for a first swim. Once again, it all worked as announced. Just as a suggestion, I really wish that the developers could use Apple Watchâ€™s inbuilt compass to show the direction of my swim on the display too.
