0,"After using this app for two years on a Pebble watch, it was hit or miss.  Moving on to an Apple Watch 2, the interface was better but motion tracking and distance recording was only slightly better.  Recent updates under iOS 12 and WatchOS 5 give much better tracking in the pool.  I still get occasional phantom laps added but overall, length tracking is very good.

The app still cannot distinguish my breaststroke from freestyle.  So frustrating. 

I wish the app allowed better data analysis of multiple workouts over a period of months, like being able to chart swolf for all of my swims.  I’m not a competitive swimmer so many of the apps features don't appeal to me.  I just don't understand why I cant look at the pace of all my freestyle sessions over time and see if I’m improving.",4,Improved tracking but data analysis still weak
1,"Strictly from an App Design standpoint, it breaks several of Apple’s UI Design Recommendations. For instance, when searching for a location, the “X” should clear out the text in the search field, because that is the standard for this UI, but in this case, it closed the location settings all together.  There are lots of other clunky and unpolished UI decisions that make it hard for me to want to engage with the app as well.  

In functionality, my pool isn’t listed so all of the leaderboard functionality is not going to work for me.  I’m surprised that it asked to read my health data, but didn’t go ahead and import all of the swims that are already recorded into their application, especially when it claims that breaststroke is my least swam stroke (it’s actually fly).

Lastly, this has a very social media feel to it in some places, especially as I was going through the privacy settings, so if that isn’t your thing (like it isn’t for me), make sure you turn your profile to private.",3,"It has potential, but still needs work."
2,"They’ve made some good improvements to the app over the last few years. I like the drill setting, and how it’s easy to edit workouts. However, stroke detection needs work. I’m a pretty experienced swimmer, with really good form, but it still thinks my butterfly is freestyle, and sometimes thinks my backstroke is breaststroke. I’m not sure if this is a bug with Apple Watch 8 (stroke detection was better on my series 5). It is good with lap count, but could be improved in recognizing sets better…even tho I do flip turns and long sets, it still divides sets into smaller sets. 

Still, I do like the improvements they’ve made in the last few years. Keep working on it.",4,"Good, but a little wonky with stroke detection"
3,"At 70 yo I sometimes ( no, all the time) need motivation in these times to get up and do something healthy   Keeping track of my daily yardage and checking cumulative weekly, monthly and annual yards against others in similar age groups keeps me getting up early and driving daily to the Y.  Having just learned to swim last year i can keep track of how my speed has been increasing.  I’m still a tortoise but it’s getting better.   Really place a lot of credit for keeping with this new hobby on this app.  Just wish the app was better able to discern between my backstroke and breaststroke.  Looks like I do a lot of breaststroke ( which I never do); preferred stroke is backstroke which I do a lot of.  Other than that I have very few complaints bout this app.",5,Use it for motivation
4,"This app has all the potential of being great but the inaccuracy of the total distance swam makes it annoying. Additionally, if you’re a  consistent long distance swimmer (+4,000meters at a time) it has a high likelihood of crashing. I’m part of a club team and we have “wall tap counters” (every time you touch the wall it counts the lap you’re on) we found the app to be about 10-20% off on the total number of laps swam. So...I have a solution for you. The reason why the app counter is wrong is because it doesn’t take into account that some swimmers have longer “strides, glides, wingspan” then others, one way you could fix that is by allowing the app to calibrate individual swimmers. At the start of your app, you should have swimmers swim 25-50 meters so that the App gets used to how many arm lengths it takes for that particular swimmer, making the app more accurate.",2,Inaccurate/buggy
5,"Installed this app because I was looking for some better views on my watch of laps, time, heart rate, etc when swimming. The Apple Workout app wasn’t cutting it for me. The watch views are exactly what I was looking for but I noticed after a couple swims that my active calories are significantly under reported compared to the Apple app. When comparing heart rate data from other workouts it seems this app is under reporting rather than other apps over reporting. The difference is significant for a 30 minute workout, about half the reported calories.",4,Good Watch Views; Questionable Activity Tracking
6,"I want to like this app. It has potential, and I’ve stuck with it for the past three years. Unfortunately, the bugs are overwhelming. Even something as simple as drill mode, where the app doesn’t need to do anything except what it is told by the user, fails to record proper distance and time. Not to mention the latest “upgrade” to drill mode that uses force touch to control it at every interval. In water, force touch doesn’t work that well, so it is a nightmare to use. What’s more, half of the time the workouts don’t upload correctly from an Apple Watch. Spend more time on bug fixes rather than continuing to push forward useless and detrimental features. Make the app solid and reliable first, then focus on upgrades.",2,Bug fixes > Useless features
7,I like this app because it’s the only one I know of that lets me edit back in my kick set yardage after the workout is done. There is no choice for a kick set in the editing section so I call them a drill. App worked well until recently then suddenly stopped uploading data to Apple health. After about one month an update was released and now everything is working properly again.,4,Stopped uploading to Apple health
8,"Easy to use and manually add my yardage. I have a iWatch but can't figure out how to use it with this site
When I click the Leaderboard, it only shows I've done 75yds so I'm obviously doing something wrong as my 3x per week swims are close to 7,500.  I'm 67 yrs of age and since covid pandemic have been away from synchronized swimming so loving the pool again 
Not techi but at least I can manually enter my yardage
Reported my pool as having changed names and it was quickly corrected!   Thank you!",5,Enjoy tracking
9,"The new iPhone app format update is the worst user interface I've ever seen. Lots of wasted space with useless bar graphs and useless lifetime totals, difficult to see your last workout data, and hard to read it when you find it. And a new focus on offering workouts but if you don't need them you're going to have to constantly navigate around that. The Apple watch workout app shows the real data a million times better. Hopefully they'll fix it because their Apple watch app is better than the workout one. 

Lastly, still useful from an old review:
There are no weekly totals, no analysis of improvement. If they improve all this stuff it could be useful.",1,Needs work on interface in phone app
10,Communicated with John who was very helpful. App has always correctly recorded times for me for the almost two years that I’ve used it. But one swim recently showed correct total time but recorded each length as exactly same time - obvious error. John guided me through a few steps and consulted with his engineer. Problem seems to have fixed itself. I appreciated John’s concern and his checking in with me later to verify app was working fine now.,5,Weird record on one particular swim
11,This app is great when it works. Just after the new iOS update the app has been buggy and lost two of my swims. I️ like that it handles rest between intervals and sets. I️ also like to set the drill mode. The Apple Watch workout app tracks in the background and it adds to your rings.  Ending a workout can be a pain since the way the Apple Watch and app are relying on pressure. Did a 4000 yard workout with my masters group and the app locked up and lost the workout. It needs serious fixes and an update. May go back to apples fitness app which is harder to handle I️. The water for drill sets.,3,Good app
12,"I haven’t even gotten around to using this app in the pool because the interface/settings are extremely cumbersome. This app won’t save your preferences on workout searches; it defaults back to the preferences you input when you set up your account. I made the “mistake” of setting up preferences that turned out to be very restrictive and only showed one workout. If I want to search for a new workout, I have to change my preferences every time I navigate away from the Workouts tab. If I favorite a workout after fiddling with my preferences for the umpteenth time, I have to change my settings yet again when I want to view those workouts.",1,Terrible functionality
13,Swim is doing a lot better with updates: a few things that I would love improved - for some reason integration with strava has the pace graph all messed up. Only when I edit my swim in the swim app in any way and then post to strava does the pace graph look like my actual swim. Also would love for the heart rate connection to strava be a lot better - there are tons of gaps that equate to zero when they should probably just be connected by a line,4,Strava integration could be better
14,"This app works. I am not sure where all the complaints come from. It counts laps, yards/meters, shows heart rate in one place. The new redesign on AW is just perfect. Especially the color coding. The stats on phone seems to be a little “cluttered” but still show all that is needed. This review comes from a guy with over 40 years of experience swimming. To developers, keep up the great work. Thanks!",5,Great app for swimmers!
15,This has been happening to me in the past month at least one a week and I was hoping the new update would fix this but it happened again today and I lost all my data! I was doing a drill and I was ready to do my last 100 yards and I looked at my watch to check my pace and the app was back to the start as if I had not just swim 2500 yards.,4,Stops working during swim
16,"Only complaint is there’s no option to NOT put in distance. Sometimes I just swim for “time” and don’t count the distance. App requires a multiple to place in the distance box. I just put in a random number and then in the notes I explain what I did on this particular training day. Other than that, app is easy to use and very useful, especially for me as a “returning swimmer”, so I can measure my progress. Cheers!",5,Awesome app!
17,"My primary complaint is that the last lap appears to throw in a couple of seconds. One can check this by comparing the splits against the last. Now to work around this problem, I simply add another 50 yards to the interval and use the next to last split and final times. And it makes a better workout!

One other request. I would like to see room on the watch face for stroke rate with the existing parameters you already show at intervals.

You are building a very good tool and our requests are a testimony that we’re using it but want more. Very common in the software business.

As I mentioned earlier I would be happy to pay for this app so don’t stop!

And thank you!",4,Still not as good as the original swimsense but it’s a very good tool.
18,I’ve used this App for 4 years and over the last year it has been crashing and dropping my swims halfway through my 3500 yard sessions. I regularly have to check and manually add 1300+ yard sets to accurately track my total distance. I submitted a report and they told me it was because I’m not running the current version (which I am on an Apple Series 6). Unfortunately this is the best tracker I have found so far so I deal with the crashes that have become a regular part of my training.,2,Used to work brilliantly
19,I like the app on the Apple watch 2 but doesn’t translate well to iPhone. The workouts usually take days to sync and the calories always show 0 even though my watch obviously picks up the movement. It just doesn’t equate to the same number of calories as the resistance brings when the watch knows that your swimming. Not sure I explained well but it’s frustrating. The only thing I like about his app is that it differentiates resting vs swimming time. Haven’t found another swimming app that does that automatically.,2,Sync issues. Doesn’t show calories.
20,"More accurate than iSwimStat, and I compare it with a couple others but this doesn’t load quickly. It takes hours or even days to show up even though I refresh many times. Not sure if I’m using it correctly.  Synched with Apple Watch.",4,Not loading stats
21,I like this app - it’s free and you can’t argue with the value for what it does (other apps charge you for stats/membership). The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is my being unable to put/list myself on leaderboard. Perhaps it’s just a learning curve - I’m using this app only for a 3-4 months. Do you know how I can fix that?,4,Great app
22,"In my opinion, the best app. It stops automatically, you have the possibility to record distance swam for drill mode (apple watch native exercise app does not offer this possibilty), you have the possibility to swim a set in a fixed amount of time (repeat in), which is another important feature that the native app does not have).",5,The best!
23,When it automatically syncs it is good but each year have problems with this. I love when it works correctly but not so much when it doesn’t. The service with issues of connectivity or syncing not much help. But it would be five stars if it worked correctly all the time.,3,A sometimes frustrating
24,"Not sure where the negative reviews are coming from regarding accuracy. This app comes within 50 yards of my 3000+ yard workouts, and gathers excellent data. The best part, however, is an easily accessible drill mode for kick sets. Best swim app available at time of this writing, and I’ve tried them all.",5,Very Accurate For Pool Swimming
25,"After 3 years of using this app, I can say it covers all the needs of the swimmer and it keeps evolving and adding functionalities.

Unmatched and highly responsive customer support makes it even better.",5,Excellent App and customer support
26,"I have used this app with my Series 2 Watch, and it worked well. The user interface is great, and accounting for kick drills is excellent. 

It needs an update however for the new Watch iOS. I don’t blame the developer, but it needs to be addressed. Blows away Apple’s swim
tracker, when it works.

UPDATE:

I have uninstalled and then reinstalled. Still doesn’t work on Apple Watch Series 3. Developer is VERY responsive, which is appreciated, but still not working. Hopefully soon because it is an excellent app, when it works.

FINAL UPDATE:

I have done everything short of sacrificing a goat to get this app to work. I even reset my Apple Watch Series 3 to factory settings. After 200 meters, watch read 50. 

Done with this app forever. Great concept, but reality is much different. It just doesn’t work.",1,Doesn’t work with Apple Watch 3
27,"I was really excited about this app, but it blocks out all relevant information and covers the face of my watch with just the time of day so it’s nearly impossible to figure out what my splits are or what comes next in the workout. I tried raising my arm, touching the screen, jiggling the Digital Crown, but nothing reliably called up the info I wanted to see. I finally gave up and went back to the watch’s built in lap tracker. Disappointing.",1,Makes Apple Watch useless
28,"Never had an issue with calorie transfer to health app until the recent update that was supposed to fix an issue regarding that. Said I burned 197,000 calories the first swim workout I completed since the new update. I have an Apple Watch 5 and iphone12 plus.",4,Recent update
29,"Frequently adds laps, even for a 100 it may record 125. It also doesn’t correctly I’d strokes. Tech support doesn’t seem interested. I have the latest pre beta version with open water tracking, they told me all bugs were fixed. I use the latest “pre” beta version which I was told had the latest algorithms   Unfortunately I see the same errors as the previous versions",2,Not consistant
30,"Have nearly 900k yards tracked with only a handful of errors. Accurate tracking, consistent splits, and one button start/stop. On top of that, developers that listen and want to fix issues and constantly make this app better. Highly recommended.",5,The Best Swim Tracker
31,"I had some issues with the Swim app on my Apple Watch a few years ago so I switched to Apple’s swim workout app -that is until Swim stopped loading the data (I think due to an Apple update)

Now that I’m using Swim again, I notice two problems. 

1) the calories count is about half what it should be on my 2250 yard swim, but agrees with Apple’s count on my 250 yard swim. 

2) I typically do a long swim (2250 yds) followed by a short (250 yd swim). My last 2 sessions (using the Swim app on my Apple Watch 3) only one swim would load on swim. 
One time the app crashed when I ended the longer swim.",4,Calorie count seems off
32,"This app is exactly what I wanted!
-build swim workouts
-track swim workouts

4/5 stars because it’s very slow and communication with my Apple Watch is a bit glitchy. Couldn’t track this morning’s swim. Saw the update and downloaded it just now so hopefully that helps.",4,Perfect but slow
33,I like the app and the ability to have my workouts on my Apple Watch.  The connection between the Watch and app does not work and when it does then the app to the activity tracker does not work.  I have followed all the suggestions in the support but it’s still unstable.  Connection to the internet is not the problem.,3,Good and Bad
34,"Downloaded the app and tried to create a new account by putting all my info in, but I clicked on create new account nothing worked.",5,Will not let me create a new account
35,The concept of the app is great and really needed as there is little support for swimmers.  I have had the app for a long time.  When it was launched I expected it would quickly start aligning with all the watches that support swimming metrics.  I support Polar who have been in the swimming space for a long time.  There is still no support for Polar or a raft of other watches.  If you want to grow your customer base surely appealing to a wider audience is a no brainer but I must be wrong!,1,What’s the point
36,"I bought my Apple Watch 6 last week. It only tracked 20 of 60 minutes in the pool. I’m starting out doing kickboard front/back crawls (no arms yet) and the tracking is wonky.

I just want to track my laps. I’m looking for the swim lap tracker for dummies. I don’t think this is it yet. I’ll try for another week but I’ll be honest. I’m looking still.",2,Noob can’t track laps
37,"Some swim sessions are not being saved. Disappeared completely out of the box 😂
It gets me frustrated, especially after swimming 4kms 🤯
The new update of the app on the apple watch displays a weird layout sometimes, buttons and labels are getting outside of the screen 😳",3,A bit disappointed
38,Great concept but the ease of use isn’t there. The app isn’t intuitive to use and is a bit behind the power curve when it comes to inputting your times. There is no option for tenths and it refers to your time as “duration.” I’m not thrilled with this at all. Did they use actual swimmers when running this thru testing? I can’t imagine they did.,2,Not thrilled
39,"I am able to adjust date of swim, but it does not save. I forget to input day of swim occasionally so unfortunately my swim is posted day late. Hope the ability to do that is fixed. Also, many times I need to input info twice for it to save.",3,Needs improvement
40,"It used to auto-import swim workouts from the health app, but for some reason they removed that feature. Now it’s back.",4,auto-imports swim workouts fixed
41,Great website to use for logging and viewing my swim stats,5,Great app enjoy using and seeing the data breakdown after my swim / very helpful.. thanks
42,Apple Watch SE owner since October 2022. For some reason the app is overstating my distance in the water today I did 500 yards the watch record of 1200 yards however using the native activity app that comes with the phone My distance was recorded accurately. Any ideas?,3,Overstating Distance
43,The leaderboard feature is absolutely incredible! Couldn’t have asked for a better tracking device!,5,Fantastic!
44,"To use this app for *anything* you have to turn over incredible amounts of personal information.  If you make any part of your profile “private” the app won’t work with any of the myriad of virtual events. The UI is an abomination and doesn’t work effectively with manual entries, making this YET ANOTHER “service” that requires a $300 watch. Very unfortunate that USMS has partnered with such a low quality venture.",1,Utter Garbage
45,Love building workouts and viewing them on my Apple Watch while swimming. Tracking accuracy is the best compared to other apps.,5,Love this App!
46,"When I complete a warm up the app will then say the workout is complete.  I have to continue the swim to continue to track the workout.  Overall, the app works well besides that glitch.",3,Error
47,"I recently got back into the pool November 2020 and was very pleased that this app would log all of my swim workouts automatically but since Jan 3rd, 2021 it doesn’t recognize them. I’m not sure what to do to fix this problem. Please help!!!",3,Unable to log my swim workouts
48,"I was swimming with Garmin watches for a long time, and switch to Apple watch.

- faster page load. The workouts page reloads every time I go to another part of the app and come back so it is slow. I would prefer it only loads when I come into the app and give me a refresh option ( pull down page)
- when you go into the details page for a workout it shows number of lengths and not the actual distance per session. The total shows in yards correctly. I would prefer to see my workout intervals in total yards, not lengths 
- more workouts to do. Options seem pretty limited to shorter distances. Master swim classes will do a 1650 for warm up. 
- drill videos would be cool. I know they are available through you tube but it would be cool if they were here and built into the workouts.",4,Getting there. A few more things and this would be really good.
101,Only works with Apple or Samsung watches. Doesn’t work with Garmin.,1,Didn’t work with Garmin device.
102,it’s work well even if the pool size is not standard lap.,5,good swimming app
103,Does not show up on my watch.,1,Useless
104,The app is so full of bugs it wouldn’t even download to use once. What a waste.,1,Don’t bother.
105,Be nice if it could be turned off or stopped when I’m done swimming,1,Stupid
106,"Only tracked 475 out of 800 meters interval. And the swim wasn’t saved as a workout, so it doesn’t show uo in the Activity app.",1,Inaccurate
107,I would love to use this with my Garmin watch and sync with training peaks.,1,How about Garmin
108,The app doesn’t do anything.,1,Useless app
109,Set up on Apple Watch. Swam 1700 yards in 25 yard pool and app recorded 350 yards swum.,1,Totally off
110,"THIS APP IS SO GOOD AND LITERALLY CHANGED MY LIFE 

DOWNLOAD NOW!!!",5,SUCH A GOOD APP
111,blah,1,Blah
112,"I have Apple’s new Series 2 watch. 

The positive: uses force touch to stop workout, which gets around the issue of the not very responsive wet touch screen you need to use to stop a workout in the native Apple pool swim app. The summary of the swim is good in that it attempts to breaks down a workout into swim time and rest time (but did not do so accurately).

The negatives: This app did not accurately detect stroke type. Listed everything as free. For example, I swam a continuous 400 yard warmup, mixing in different strokes. It listed everything freestyle and invented resting stops, many after a single 25 yard length, where I swam continuously.  The rest of my workout consisted of 100 yard and 200 yard free sets.  Again the app invented rest stops after many 25 yard lengths, invented a set of 225 yards. No heart beat monitor. No calorie estimate. (not really necessary but since the data is there it'd be good to incorporate). Hopefully the app will be improved, I like the concept.",2,Needs much improvement
113,"At first I was disappointed that the app didn't count my breaststroke or kick sets, but the more I use it, I see that it's algorithm is learning my strokes and adapting its analysis. All my breaststroke is now counted accurately and is starting to sometimes give me credit for kick sets. 

Even if it never quite gets the kicks counted, the ability to sense the difference between swimming and resting and the stats (some of which you can access immediately) put this app head and shoulders above the others I've tried on the Apple Watch.",4,Works well with Apple Watch
114,"Still a little buggy. I uninstalled, then reinstalled after the app crashed when I still had 20 laps to complete. It may have been the Apple Watch because the Apple logo appeared and I couldn't bring up any apps. I thought maybe the watch was downloading an IOS update or something. Whatever. It's just very frustrating. I lost all of today's data. Maybe my resistance gloves got in the way and pressed the stem. Other than that, I like this app. Some issues with lap count and stroke recognition though. Not a big deal for a casual swimmer like me.",5,Swim
115,"This app seems to have promise, but for this swimmer of quite modest abilities, it is not yet ready to replace my Garmin swim watch.

1. Accuracy. On a swim of 1300 yards, it came up 75 yards short. My Garmin has rarely missed, and then it was usually because I did something unusual like stop to adjust my goggles mid-lap.

2. Missing features. The app has no equivalent of the Garmin Drill Mode, which lets you record activities such as using a kick board and flippers. So it couldn't record several hundred yards of my workout.

3. Not optimized for interval swimming. It could figure out when I was swimming or stopped, and (usually) how long I had swum for each interval and its duration. But it did NOT give either elapsed time since the start of the last interval, or the start of the last rest period, both of which are available on the Garmin. These should be basic features of any swim  watch software.

I will watch for software updates before trying again.",3,E for effort
116,"I have just started using this new app for my swim routines and I can say that this is one of the better swim apps out there so far. I love being able to track my workouts and comparing lap times with my friends and other people who are using this app with ease. Not only that, just from using the app today, I found a few new local pools in my area that I didn't know even existed before! Now that the new Apple Watch is waterproof, this is my go-to swim app to use with it.",5,Best swim app I've used so far!
117,"I've been using this app with my Apple Watch Series 2 for about three weeks. I have not tried to get super accurate information from it, but it does a very nice job of tracking my yardage and giving me a sense of how I was performing. 

The quick drill setup on the watch is an excellent way to capture those kicking yards that don't get logged by the watch. 

Overall, I am very pleased with the app, and it seems like they keep tweaking it and making it better each time.",4,3 Weeks in and it is good
118,"Bought a new waterproof Apple Watch last week, been shopping for best swim app. My master swim mates recommended this app to me. Absolutely love it!!  Love the fact that this app not only can track my daily swim workout, but also allow me to connect with other swimmers.  The best feature is that I can locate the pool close by using this app. This is huge for me since I need to travel a lot because of work, this make my life much easier as I want to keep swimming every day.",5,Best swim app for Apple Watch so far
119,"The app is slow and clunky with an unintuitive interface. Instead of focusing on giving us quick and easy access to our swimming metrics, this app seems to instead focus more on social stuff and finding swimming pools (which it isn't very good at) and it has the word ""unknown"" misspelled as well. Building a custom workout is actually way harder and slower than it should be, plus you constantly have to wait for the app to contact the servers because no one on the development team thought people might want to store their data locally on their phone. 

It's not terrible but it certainly isn't good.",2,Slow and clunky
120,"The watch app is great. It's much more fully featured than apple's swim tracking app. 

However, the iOS software is pretty bad. The swimming stats are poorly organized, and the totals are usually incorrect. For example, any workouts from the current day don't apply to the weekly total.  Also, the charts are wrong (showing workouts which didn't occur). 

Please update the iOS app and fix the bugs!",4,Great watch sw. Poor iOS sw.
121,"Have been using this app with an Appe Watch 2.0 for a few months and have seen steady improvements in what it can do. Appreciate being able to record the skills distances within a workout now. Did have some issues with breast stroke detection, but that seems to be better after current update. Would like to see calories and sharing out from mobile app like you can in web site. Great app!",5,Works Great!
122,I had a Garmin swim before and hated constantly pressing the button to start and stop intervals. That this app automatically distinguishes between intervals and resting at the wall is the single best feature for me. This is also a big improvement over the previous version which required scrolling to see everything and crashed a lot.,5,Love the automatic interval detection!
123,"Drill feature is great, so I use this over the built in app. However anything I do fast over a 50 is counted wrong. Did last 4 times I've done a 100 fast I'll go in the 55-56 range it gives me a time of 1 minutes and says I only did a 75.  Same thing for the 200, only days I've done a 175.  Times are also off. It thinks I'm resting almost 5 seconds after I have actually finished.  Overall not terrible, drill mode is the only thing that keeps me using it since I can add back in those laps it missed.",2,Fast swimming count and times off
124,"Apple's built-in activity app is very accurate for tracking distance and deducing stroke type, but it requires manually stopping its chronometer to check time on individual sets, save or discard the record and launch a new activity before a new set. Very tedious! 

This app has been very good at stopping the clock when I come to a rest and smart enough to reset the clock to zero before I start swimming again. Big thumps up! Unfortunately, its distance and stroke count is horribly inaccurate. At the moment, I can only use it as a smart chronometer.

It also nags about gaining access to health data numerous times a day. Very annoying. Ask once and stop bothering me for at least a week. 

Hoping for the bugs to be fixed or a better alternative app to be launched.",3,Inaccurate distance tracking
125,"The Apple Watch app is very reliable for auto-detecting sets (no need to push buttons:-) and strokes. It also has a very easy way to include drill/kicking sets. 

Overall, it's a great app for swimmers!

Suggestion: While HR data from the watch is not always accurate, it would still be useful to have that displayed with the rest of the workout stats.",4,Solid performance!
126,"I really enjoy using this app with my new Apple Watch and the additional details such as split times, swimmers in my area, clubs, etc not available with Apple'a app. The UI needs a little more user flexibility as I had to contact technical support to change my location. Highly recommended, otherwise.",5,"Great App, especially with Apple Watch"
127,"This is a great app for swimming. I like that it captures my drill sets and also returns what I ""just"" swam. I gave it a four star because it's buggy and not working on my Apple Watch. I'm sure it'll get fixed quite soon. Give it a try. I won't be so quick to update, I'll wait on every other one. :)",5,Just updated and app stop working
128,"I'm happy with the app and website overall, but a few weeks ago the yards I enter in Drill Mode on my Apple Watch don't transfer to the app or website even though they show up on my watch.  It is basically a waste of time to use the drill mode since none of the yards show up.  I contacted customer service about this a few weeks ago and never heard any response.",3,"Really nice app, but drill mode still broken"
129,"I use the app frequently and all works well and great!... until... i would say about 1 out 10 swims the screen gets activated and mess up the swim tracking. My last one it wiped out the whole work out. 

So i guess you can turn on the water protection, but then you can glance during swim on progress/time/heartrate... 

Otherwise great app",4,Great swim app... BUT!
130,I didn't want to spend more money on the new AppleWatch to be able to swim. I bought a waterproof cover for my current Apple Watch and this app has helped me track my swimming. I'm also glad they added a drill component. This has been very helpful. You will enjoy this app.,5,Great Option for AppleWatch Series 1
131,"I find this app kind of spotty. For instance, it doesn't seem to capture different strokes mid workout. If I'm doing freestyle and switch to breaststroke it skips a lap or two before it picks it up. It also doesn't capture all my workouts although that could be a function of a recent update, that wiped out a couple workouts. In any case, I don't find it that much better than what Apple Watch gives you.",3,Just ok
132,"I just returned to lap swimming and tried the app. It was accurate for distance, strokes and time. I wish it showed calories burned. Are you able to run the swim app and the Apple Watch workout app at the same time? The Apple Watch workout app doesn't display different strokes, but does measure calories.",4,"Good app, but needs improvement"
133,I bought a watch specifically for the swim app and workout tracking and with every upgrade it seems to get worse. Now none of my workouts at all are displayed. Needs serious QE testing. Signed disappointed swimmer!,5,Upgrades and swim workout sync are a mess
134,"When this app is working it's Awesome! It's accurate, it's user friendly, it does everything I was looking for in a swim app. I loved it!!
That's the Good. The Bad.
Lately its crashing. I've lost two swims.. one was almost complete for 3800 yards.. the other crashed twice during my swim.
The Ugly. Your customer support is 
Horrible!! It's been over a week and I've not heard a word. Are you addressing this problem? Do you even care? I'd give this app 5+ stars. 
It's that good.. but your customer follow through is awful! Please fix!",5,"The Good, the Bad and the very Ugly."
135,"I have never felt so disappointed about an app as this one. It glitches out and doesn't record anything every third to every other time I swim. I originally got this app for the stroke count and because it could differentiate between each set. I don't know what the purpose of using it is if it glitches out so often. Rest assured it will be deleted. FYI, this week out of the 5 times I swam, it recorded 3. DISAPPOINTING",1,Extremely disappointed. Glitches out DURING swim practice every third time
136,"Pebble Time works great to track your distance during the workout. But syncing the Pebble to the app is Russian roulette. Every few work outs it will not only NOT sync the work out but will delete the workout too! Really frustrating when you are trying to track progress and use goals to motivate.

Really disappointed that they couldn't get this fundamental part of the whole app sorted out by now!",2,App sync is spotty at best!
137,"After using this app for about a month, ~ 3 times a week, all performance measures noticeably improved. This has also reflected in swim style improvements that my co swimmers noticed. 

Highly recommend to all skill level swimmers.",5,Love this app - best for swimmers 👍👌👆
138,Got my workout exactly right even the first time. Apple's workout app never did no matter what I tried. Allows to edit workout if needed (I could remove my experimental drill). Amazed!,5,WAY better than native workout app
139,"Since getting the new waterproof Apple Watch, I have been searching for a great swim tracking app.  This looked like it might be the one - until I discovered that there is. I way to tell the app about pools that it does not already recognize.  I swim in my own pool, and that means I am out of luck.  Seems like a very silly omission.",3,Really wanted to like this
140,"I love the app, but consistently run in to issues with the app closing part way through my swim. This make it difficult to accurately track my workouts. 

I am running this on a 1st generation AppleWatch with a Catalyst, waterproof watch case. 

Hope they can create a more stable app.",4,Best Swim App so far
141,Drill mode and send off timer took a bit of time to get use to but this has become my go to app for my swim workouts.  Best app I have found for Apple Watch for tracking Swim workouts.,5,Works as expected
142,"I have been using MySwimPro since mid Janurary 2017. I am 64 years old and use it daily from my Apple Series 2 watch. It does all I need it to do and I am sure more. I just needed it to count my laps but I can see other great information like elapse time, calories and pulse. I love this app.

I have not tried all the other great parts of the app. 

The support is excellent. I had a few questions and Adam Oxner replied that day. There was an app fix the next day. 

Thanks MySwimPro team.",5,Great swim tracker
143,"Great new app. As someone who loves swimming I appreciate having this new app a lot. The app is great but definitely needs some improvements.
Since this is a new app I am giving it 5 stars and will be waiting for new releases.",5,Love it
144,"Apple watch app froze the second time I used it, requiring me to uninstall and reinstall (which deleted my swim.) When I tried to add the work out manually, it required the facility (why?) but didn't have the facility in its database. All that said, it is a free app so you get what you pay for.",3,Not quite ready for prime time
145,Counting laps was a pain and I would always loose my count in reaching my goal each day. Now with this app I don't have to worry about it as it know exactly where I am and how much I have done.,5,Amazing
146,"I use this app all the time and really like it. The stats, number of laps, heart beat rate, everything gets counted. I only wish #of strokes would get back, disappeared after the update.",5,Great swimming app
147,This app works great! I have had no issues uploading all of my workouts from my Garmin swim watch. I also like being able to connect with the other swimmers in my club.,5,Great Swim App!!
148,"As a triathlete, this app allows me to track every single workout and is providing me with the details I need to check on my improvements. Highly recommended",5,Love it
149,"This app works great for my Apple Watch 2 for capturing all my swimming data, including drills when I'm not moving my arms. I like the detailed data breakdown, workout analysis, and accurate lap count.",5,Great Workout App
150,"The interface and ability to record kick sets held a lot of promise. But, alas, during my first workout the app recorded 175 yards for my 400 yard warmup. It was flummoxed by my 100 IM, recording only 25 yards... I switched mid workout to the native activity/swim app and it accurately counted the rest of my workout. 
I'll be deleting this app. Maybe they will improve in the future. 
Also I am concerned that it does not water lock the watch.",1,Not accurate
151,"Great app, very well-rounded. One of the best feature is the pool finder and seeing other people tracking their progress. Tried some other apps and like this one the best.",5,Love the pool finder feature!

154,"App works great with Apple 2 watch. My favorite parts...ability to easily select different pool sizes, the fact that it knows when I'm taking a breather. Great app!",5,Does it's job
155,"Love that I can use my pebble time to track my swims, but syncing is a crapshoot. Probably 30% of the time sync fails and workout data is lost.  Workout info on phone is minimal - would be nice to have workout breakdowns like on the website. HealthKit integration would be nice too.",3,Needs Work
156,"An app for the Apple Watch that is 1. Accurate 2. Allows you to select the option to do drills as you are swimming 3. Is free 4. Is awesome.

158,"This is the best swim app so far. I can connect with other clubs and swimmer. Its nice to locate pools around you within the app. Finally, i can track my Swims. Cant wait to go swimming again ❤️",5,Love it!!!!!
159,Load up your pool of choice or find one. The apps knows the size of pool.  Starts when you start.  Counts the strokes.  Splits. All totals up.  Great for all levels of swimmers.,5,Great easy app

162,"Tried in a few swims. First swim seemed to routinely miss the last 25 off each interval. Couldn't accurately detect stoke type.

Next swim I start tracking, swim 400m and look at watch to see 75m. Using Apple Watch 2.

Interface is very slow and non native, forced to setup an account with a login system that disallows certain characters for email but allows you to create the account, just not login ever again. Password must be short and bad.

I would forgive those bits of tracking actually worked.",2,Use apple activity swim mode instead
163,"Easy to navigate, with good tracking for my personal progress. Looking forward to using the leaderboard for motivation. Hassle free device pairing.",5,Initial impressions
164,"This app seems to be early beta status.

1. Like other users, uploading is spotty at best.

2.  App is pretty limited on what you can log about workout.  Easier for me just to go to website on a pc.

3.  I use Pebble time, and accuracy on lap counting is pretty horrible.  I swim 1-2 miles per workout and it does not track well.  Drills and sprints seem to track better,  maybe because motion is more vigorous than my distance swims. 

Ill give it another month and update if they have managed to make something of this.",2,"Im hopeful, but disapointed so far"
165,"Good way to track swimming activity. Knows when you're resting, which the Workout app isn't able to do.",4,Everything I need for daily swim
166,I found Lapse are not counted accurately recorded. I tried using distance and lap count. Distance is more accurate. The Lap count recorded each length of 25 yards/meters as 1/2 lap. It also missed more laps than distance.,4,Swim works but.....

168,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The past three times it wouldn't sync, no matter WHAT I did. I followed instructions, but wouldn't sync the new workouts. I would LOVE to be able to count on this app to work. Hopefully they will fix it soon.",2,Works sometimes
169,"Whether you're a recreational swimmer or a competitive one, this app does it all! Definitely a great addition to my training!",5,This app is fantastic!!
170,Unfortunately when you are done and try to upload the workout the app does not synchronize the data from Pebble. It's worth noting the watch app works amazing accurately but it is a shame the data cannot be uploaded to track your swimming activities,2,App does not synchronize
171,The app works well and is reasonably accurate on lap count. Fails miserably on breast stroke. I like the drill mode for kicking and use that to handle breast stroke failing. Wish the drill mode entry of length was better.,4,Decent for the price
172,"The app is accurate on tracking, but cannot determine my location. I also cannot manually input my profile detail or even input the pool I visit. Seems if you do not live in the US  you can not make your swimming great again.",2,Bad support

208,"I swam with a pool mate for about 9 months until it failed, then a Garmin for 2 years.  For now, I swim in two pools - a 20 yard and a 25 yard.  This review reflect this context

Distance measures:  The swim app is reasonably accurate - I've only seen it drop 25 yards in about 10,000.  I never saw the Garmin miss, but I'd say the two are about equal.

Timing:  The time measures are equal to the Garmin, although the Swim app is much harder to stop.  I've had to go back to the locker room to dry both the watch and my hand to make it stop a session.  

Intervals.  The Swim app is horrible for intervals.  Not only is it difficult to stop a session with with a force press, the auto rest takes 3 or 4 seconds to activate, which would be so bad except that the interval log senses many more stops.  In a single 4,000 yard swim it might register 15 intervals.  When I'm doing a mix on 500 and 100 yard sets, it can't recognize a single one - not if I'm manually pausing or relying on resting my arm on the edge of the pool and watching it go into rest mode.  Why does it take 4 seconds to say Rest, but will measure more than I dozen if I'm not stopping?  The Garmin is far better here.

Lap counts:  With the Garmin I lost the ability to count to 10 - it was so easy to look down at a turn and see the yardage count.  The Swim apps should have a feature to have a constant display - or at least on turns - of the lap or yardage count.  Right now I have to stop and press the face up to five times to make it show me progress.

Pools size changes:  I've tried to manually input my local 20 yard pool, but I don't think the developers like urban settings.  The Y or the length never stick.  Several clicks on the Garmin, but at least it will change pool size.

Overal, the Garmin wins on points, but the Swim apps wins on convenience.  I just hope that it gets better over time.",3,Poor execution
209,"Edit: I did receive another response from technical support, once again explaining how the custom length feature works but failing to address the fact that it does not work. I am on an Apple Watch series 2 with an IPhone 7, both updated and the custom length feature does nothing. I set it for 20 yards and that option (or any other custom distance I try) simply doesn't appear on the watch. 

Also, again, if you're going to state it takes 48 hours to respond then respond in 48 hours - not months later and with a lengthy diatribe about how busy you've been. 

I was desperate for this app to work, but the custom pool size feature will not function on my Apple Watch. I have tried every method I can to get it to function, including deleting and redownloading, restarting etc. My watch and iPhone are fully updated as well. 

I submitted a ticket in early October and was told I would receive a response in 48 hours. On November 19th I submitted another ticket complaining that I hadn't gotten a response, and was told I'd receive one in 48 hours. Several days later I got a pat response telling me how to use their custom pool size feature, but not addressing the fact that it doesn't work. I responded and was told that I'd get a response to that in... 48 hours. I've still heard nothing. 

If you're going to include a feature it better work, or you should at least address that when someone asks. Maybe it's just me - but I doubt it. There are probably hundreds of users who can't get this feature to work. 

At this point between your faulty features and terrible customer service I'll wait to deal with one of your competitors that gets custom pool sizes into their app.",1,Faulty features - terrible support

212,"Tried using it with my Apple Watch but it couldn’t tell when I ended a lap and I had to manually advance to the next drill. Didn’t log as a workout either in the swim.com app or apple workouts. 

Love the idea of getting workouts on my watch but not helpful if I can’t track my progress. Easier to just print out a workout and stick it on a spare kickboard.",2,Does not sync
213,I am not sure why my time on swim.com is faster than my time on my activity when I start there but the distance is the same. Great otherwise,3,My activity app and this app swim times are different
214,"I’ve been using the swim.com app for more than a year and I like it a lot. There are however, a few points that could be improved:
- Workout management - I constantly have issues with my workouts. They disappear from my favorites, I lose my edits and they get messed up on my Apple Watch. 
- It would be great if it was possible to create/edit workouts on a browser instead of being limited to the app. 
- On many occasions my Apple Watch loses track of my laps, adding extra yards or not counting a lap. 
- The guided workouts (I know it is an experimental version yet) could be improved. Sometimes the intervals are not recorded and it would be useful to have a way to view the next interval. 

In general it is a pretty cool app and I’ll definitely keep using it!",4,Nice app but still needs some bug fixes
215,"I got this app to track open water swims. As stand-alone app, it’s quite good. Distance is much more accurate than with Apple Watch, and it even includes breast stroke distance, but calories only appear in iPhone fitness app after a lag, and don’t count towards daily move goal. Distance appears to be the inaccurate Apple Watch measure. Also, there’s no information about strokes swum. 

I’ll wait until these bugs are fixed before using swim.com to track my swims.",2,"Nice screen for Apple Watch, but it doesn’t communicate with iPhone fitness app"
216,"The most annoying thing about the swim.com app is that if you don’t enter the challenges on the day that they start… all swims prior to when you enter the challenge do not count EVEN if they were swum during the challenge duration time. For example… challenge goes from sept 02-October02, you swim on the 2 and 3rd but don’t see the new challenge until the 4th.. TOO BAD those yards don’t count for the challenge. There should be a way for swim.com to remedy this. It makes swimmers discouraged to sign up for the challenges.",3,Challenges Issues
217,"I have used swim.com for many years and now it has been more of an irritant than anything else. Swim sets freeze up, drills are inaccurately reported from the watch to the phone and many lost swim sessions because the software just crashes on the watch. I have updated everything and your software continues to be very problematic. Unfortunately I’ve been using it for about 10 years and really enjoyed it until now. I have sent number of support emails to the appAnd they have not responded. Really disappointed and with swim.com",2,Many problems w APP and Apple Watch
218,"While the app seems work accurately in the pool, I've had several problems. First, I signed up with an account with my Appl Strava manually. Files aren't recognized. I fine ID through the app. However, the browser version has no option to sign in with Apple ID. I emailed support about that, but I've still received no response after a week. Also, after multiple attempts and consultations with their support blog, I can't get it to export to Strava automatically. Then, when I tried to export FIT files manually, Strava wouldn't recognize the files. I then opened a new account with my email address so I would be able to login through the browser. I then tried to import the workouts from my other account, but Swim.com didn't even recognize its own FIT files created by their own app. It seems like this app isn't being kept up to date, and their support department has gone AWOL.",1,So far not so good
219,"Since going mobile and making the website non-functional, Swim.com is less and less appealing. It has limited functionality and access to less information. Why not do both, the website is up but removed access to workouts. Easier to compare workouts on website.",1,Limited
220,"This is the best lap tracker I’ve found, however, there’s one annoying thing about its integration with the phone’s activity app:  after finishing a morning swim, my watch will say I’m at like 800 calories in the movement ring, but if I view my swim details on my phone’s Swim.com app, the total calories for the swim suddenly drop to about 200 calories.  I’m fairly certain the 800 cal is accurate for a 50 minute hard swim.

A feature that would be great to add is an interval timer, that can be viewed during the interval swim.  It’s nice to view an interval when resting afterwards by swiping left, but it would be really nice to see the interval’s progress when glancing at the watch during a turn.  The total swim time is kind of worthless, imho.

Thanks.",4,Excellent app except for a couple of things
221,Good. Never opened or used but I rlly love it BEST APP EVER !!,5,Yay SWIM.com
222,I am getting into swimming and I love the Swim.com Leaderboards. I also tried other apps but the swim tracking was not as accurate as Swim.com’s proprietary tracking algorithms. Love it!!,5,The best swim tracking app!
223,It is accurate with yardage and stroke recognition. I like the drill and pace function. My biggest issue is the poor data transfer back to the iPhone app. Sometimes it works and other times it will not transfer back to the phone. I have tried most swim tracker apps and like the swim.com watch interface.  This app is the only one that has insistent issues with data transfers. When this is fixed I’ll start using it again.,3,Hit and miss
224,"I love this app because the swim.com leaderboard has inspired me to swim an incredible distance, over 4000 km in two years. I have moved up from 271 to number 2 on the worldwide total distance leaderboard. 

I love this app because I can look at workout statistics after each workout that is uploaded to swim.com. 

I hate this app because it randomly refuses to upload  my workouts from my Apple Watch to swim.com app on the phone. Surprisingly, it will upload those workouts to the apple activity app for total distance only. But then I get no credit for the leaderboard on Swim.com. By my I have lost up to 100 km of leaderboard distance credit this way. 

I hate this app because the feature of leaderboard filter over specific time periods eg distance last week, last month, last 2 months, etc. has never worked. 

I hate this app because I have contacted swim.com multiple times about these issues. While the written responses are very friendly, nothing is fixed. 

There is so much promise to this app if it would just be tweaked to work better.",3,Love/Hate
225,"This app worked great for me for about a month. I love the drill function as I do a fair amount of kicking and one armed fly drills. And the planned workout integration is nice for more advanced swimmers. My only suggestion would be to allow more data integration into the activity app so you can see sets there (like you can if you use the Apple Watch Workout app). But just a suggestion as the Swim.com app does allow this. 

Then the swim.col app stopped syncing with the health app. My privacy settings are set to allow the swim.com app to write and read the motion and fitness data. My sources are all setup in the health app. Nothing syncs. Started suddenly and for no apparent reason (no iOS or app updates happened between when it was working and now). I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling all sorts of apps. Restarting the phone and watch. Hard restarting the phone. Even restoring my iPhone. No dice. The biggest problem for me is that I no longer see a workout logged in activity app. I get the exercise credits because my heart rate was up, but no workout is logged. 

I have contacted the app developers several times. No response. I will have to stop using this app and start using the workout app. And manually logging kicking yards. I’d really much prefer to not do this, but oh well. Perhaps it’ll start working at some point. Tomorrow I am going to try running both apps and see what happens.",2,Great until it stops syncing with the health app
226,I have used this app with my old Apple Watch Series 2 and tried again with the Series 4. It continues to overestimate my laps. The native Apple Watch swimming app and MySwimPro are and have been both spot-on when it comes to counting my laps and distance. Not sure what the issue is with the Swim.com app and it’s a shame. I really wanted to use this app for my pool swimming.,2,Tracking still way off for me
227,I want to use this app. I love swim.com and use it to track workouts. I have to export and upload from the default Apple application. The app only properly detects crawl and will not count breaststroke and leaves big gaps in the workouts.,2,Inaccurate stroke accuracy
228,"***Update - 02-10-2017
More updates have been made and there have been a couple of improvements that I would like to mention. I have also increased the rating from 2 stars to 3. 
The first update was the addition of the countdown timer. This allows me to set a time to do repeated sets on. Ideally I would be able to input an entire workout and it would guide me with what the next set is to be and when to start and how long to take, but this is still very helpful. One improvement would be if it was able to give a 5 second haptic countdown before haptically buzzing on the set off time. But that is nitpicking. 
Secondly, they have added the ability to chose workouts on the app. I like where this is going, but haven't had success in tailoring a workout to exactly what I am looking for on my pace. And if it cannot be uploaded to the watch to be my guide then there is no point anyways. 
Third, the ability to edit the results of a workout on the phone app is great. 
The app now seems better able to determine what strokes I am doing. 
One problem that still remains, and it is a big one, is the accuracy to determine starting and stopping. It is still way off, and this makes knowing your real pace impossible, and even trips some segments to stop while you are actually just in your streamline kick after a turn.
But all in all, it seems to be improving. 

***Update - 12-19-2016
After a few updates there has still been no progress made in improving the accuracy. Consistently now it improperly guesses the stroke type of my first warmup lap and short changes me by 25 yards. And the 5-10 second lag to start and stop hasn't improved either.

While this app may be the best swimming app out there, I am overall regretting getting an Apple Watch series 2 to use for swimming. 

***Original review:
When I started to research smart watches to pair with my iPhone one of the main features that I was looking for was a good swimming app. I wanted the ability to program it with a swimming workout and have it track my distance and pace and countdown when to start the next interval. For some reason, I thought this app would do this, and so I bought an Apple Watch. Unfortunately, this app does not do this.

So what does this app do? When you are about to get in the pool you pull up the app on your watch and you select start workout. It then records when you are swimming and when you are resting. At the end of the workout you select end workout.

Once you are done you can go to the app on your phone or you can log into your account on a computer. From there you can see all of your intervals broken down by individual lengths of the pool with the time, your pace/100, stroke count and some other metrics. It even guesses which stroke type you are doing. 

So even without having the app be able to guide a workout, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. I would give it 4 if they would add the time of day to each segment as well as this can be useful later. 

Why then do I give it 2 stars? Because it isn't very good at knowing when you stop and start an interval. It's off by 5-10 seconds at each end. This makes it useless if you are doing sets of short distances. I am sincerely hoping that this is a problem of the app software and not of the Apple Watch hardware. One of the features of their website is even your fastest 50 freestyle. I don't know why they would have this feature if the accuracy is 5 seconds off on a 25 second distance.

Other problems that I have noticed are that sometimes it mistakes which stroke a length is, and sometimes it will register 50 yards as only 25.

So for now it gets 2 stars. It works as an app that almost records how far I swim in a given workout. Beyond that is sketchy at best.",2,Great Concept. Poor Execution.
229,App.has gone from functional to brick. Says it cannot connect to server.,2,Dead app
230,"It's January now and I haven't been able to sync between my Pebble and this app since August, and I've tried all kinds of gyrations to try and get them to sync. Now it is much WORSE. I just updated the Pebble part of the Swim duo and it has completely taken over my watch. I kill the swim app and it comes back before I can get to any other menu item, so I can't even reboot the watch. And this version still asks to be made my Activity app every.single.time.it.runs no matter that I keep saying no. If it was a person, we would call that a Narcissistic Personality Disorder. The ONLY reason I keep using is because the stopwatch digits are big and easy to read while I'm in the pool and not wearing my glasses.",1,Poor experience with Pebble
